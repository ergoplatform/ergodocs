# Implementation Details for UTXO Set Snapshots

The UTXO set authentication uses an AVL+ tree, outlined in [this research paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/994.pdf) and available in the [Scrypto framework](https://github.com/input-output-hk/scrypto) on GitHub. Snapshots are taken every 51,200 blocks (~72 days), specifically after a block where *h % 51200 == 51199*.

[This research paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/129) indicates that this method can be as secure as processing all blocks under certain statistical assumptions.

## Technical Workflow (WIP)

A pruned client downloads all headers, validates proofs-of-work, and links structures, followed by downloading a UTXO snapshot from peers and the full blocks succeeding it. The process is as follows:

1. **ErgoSyncInfo**: Message to connected peers.
2. Receive `INV` message with better block ids.
3. Request headers for received ids.
4. **On Header Reception**:

    ```java
    if(History.apply(header).isSuccess) {
        if(!(localScore == networkScore)) GOTO 1
        else GOTO 5
    } else {
        blacklist peer
    }
    ```

5. Request `UTXOManifest` for at least `BlocksToKeep` back.
6. **On `UTXOSnapshotManifest` Reception**:

    ```java
    UTXOSnapshotManifest.chunks.foreach { chunk =>
        request chunk from sender() //Or from random full node
    }
    ```

7. **On `UTXOSnapshotChunk` Reception**:

    ```java
    State.applyChunk(UTXOSnapshotChunk) match {
         case Success(Some(newMinimalState)) => GOTO 8
         case Success(None) => stay at 7
         //Request missed chunks periodically
         case Failure(e) => ???
         //Invalid hash or state
    }
    ```

8. Request `BlockTransactions` starting from available State.

    ```java
    History.headersStartingFromId(State.headerId).foreach { header =>
        send message(GetBlockTransactionsForHeader(header)) to Random full node
    }
    ```

9. **On `BlockTransactions` Reception**: same as Fullnode.7.
10. Operate as Fullnode.

This revised workflow streamlines the operation of a pruned full node, emphasizing efficiency and security, positioning Ergo and similar blockchains for broader adoption within the constraints of typical hardware.
