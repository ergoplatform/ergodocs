# Full-Node Mode

- [Full *'Archival'* Node Mode](archival-node.md): This is the standard mode, similar to a full Bitcoin node.
- [Pruned-Fullnode Mode](pruned-full-node.md): Downloads all headers, validates proofs-of-work, and links structures, followed by downloading a UTXO snapshot from peers and the full blocks succeeding it.
