Please refer to [conf](conf.md)

<!--[View code on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ergoplatform/ergo/master/src/main/resources/application.conf)

The code in this file is responsible for configuring various settings for the Ergo project. It covers settings related to the node, wallet, network, and caching. The node settings include options for state type, transaction verification, block storage, mining, and mempool management. The wallet settings cover secret storage, seed strength, mnemonic phrase language, and transaction fee management. The network settings handle connection management, peer discovery, and synchronization. The cache settings optimize memory usage for various components.

For example, in the node settings, `stateType` can be set to "utxo" or "digest" to determine how the node maintains its state. The `verifyTransactions` setting enables or disables transaction verification. The `blocksToKeep` setting determines how many blocks with transactions and ADproofs are stored.

In the wallet settings, `seedStrengthBits` determines the strength of the generated seed, and `mnemonicPhraseLanguage` sets the language for the mnemonic seed. The `defaultTransactionFee` sets the fee used when it's not specified in a transaction.

In the network settings, `knownPeers` is a list of well-known nodes to connect to, and `maxConnections` sets the maximum number of network connections. The `syncInterval` and `syncTimeout` settings control the synchronization process.

In the cache settings, various cache sizes are defined for different components, such as `blockSectionsCacheSize` for block sections and `headersCacheSize` for headers.

These configurations allow the Ergo project to be fine-tuned for different use cases and environments, ensuring optimal performance and resource usage.

## ergo

### node 

Settings for node view holder regime. See papers.yellow.ModifiersProcessing.md

#### stateType
```conf
stateType = "utxo"
```

State type.  Possible options are:

- "utxo" - keep full utxo set, that allows to validate arbitrary block and generate ADProofs
- "digest" - keep state root hash only and validate transactions via ADProofs

#### verifyTransactions
```conf
verifyTransactions = true
```

Download block transactions and verify them (requires BlocksToKeep == 0 if disabled)

#### blocksToKeep

```conf
blocksToKeep = -1
```

Number of last blocks to keep with transactions and ADproofs, for all other blocks only the header will be stored.

Keep all blocks from genesis if negative
Please do not set it more than 114,688 (default adProofsSuffixLength), otherwise, it could be hard to find proofs around the peers

### utxoBootstrap

```conf
# Download and apply UTXO set snapshot and full-blocks after that
utxoBootstrap = false
```

#### PoPoWBootstrap
```conf
PoPoWBootstrap = false
```

Download PoPoW proof on node bootstrap

#### minimalSuffix
```conf
minimalSuffix = 10
```

Minimal suffix size for PoPoW proof (may be pre-defined constant or settings parameter)

#### mining
```conf
mining = false
```

Is the node is doing mining

#### maxTransactionCost
```conf
maxTransactionCost = 1000000
```

maximum cost of transaction for it to be propagated
#### maxTransactionSize
```conf
maxTransactionSize = 98304 // 96 kb
```

Maximum size of transaction to be accepted into mempool

#### useExternalMiner
```conf
useExternalMiner = true
```

Use external miner, native miner is used if set to `false`

#### internalMinersCount
```conf
internalMinersCount = 1
```
How many internal miner threads to spawn (used mainly for testing)
#### internalMinerPollingInterval
```conf
internalMinerPollingInterval = 500ms
```

How frequently to ask for new block candidate
#### miningPubKeyHex

```conf
miningPubKeyHex = null
```

Public key mining rewards will be dedicated to (P2PK address is also accepted)

#### offlineGeneration
```conf
offlineGeneration = false
```

If true, a node generates blocks being offline. The only really useful case for it probably is to start a new blockchain

#### keepVersions
```conf
keepVersions = 200
```

Number of state snapshot diffs to keep. Defines maximum rollback depth

#### acceptableChainUpdateDelay
```conf
acceptableChainUpdateDelay = 30m
```
Acceptable difference between NOW and timestamp of the latest chain update or best block. This helps to discover syncing issues.

#### mempoolCapacity

Maximum number of unconfirmed transactions node can accept

```conf
mempoolCapacity = 1000
```
#### mempoolCleanupDuration
```conf
mempoolCleanupDuration = 30m
```

Interval for mempool transaction re-check. We check transaction when it is entering the mempool, and then re-check it every interval valie

#### mempoolSorting
```conf
mempoolSorting = "random"
```

Mempool transaction sorting scheme ("random", "bySize", or "byExecutionCost")

#### rebroadcastCount
```conf
rebroadcastCount = 3
```

Number of transactions from mempool to be re-broadcasted at each epoch

#### minimalFeeAmount
```conf
minimalFeeAmount = 1000000
```

Minimal fee amount of transactions mempool accepts

#### blacklistedTransactions

```conf
blacklistedTransactions = []
```

List with hex-encoded identifiers of transactions banned from getting into memory pool

#### headerChainDiff

```conf
# default value is 100 blocks ~= 200 minutes
headerChainDiff = 100
```
The node is downloading headers first and only then full blocks. Depending on settings, the node is downloading whether a suffix of the blockchain (if stateType = "digest" and "blocksToKeep" >= 0) or all the full blocks (otherwise).

The node is considering that the headers-chain is synced if it sees a header of a block generated closely to the current moment. The node considers that a header is close if its timestamp is no more than "headerChainDiff" blocks on average than node's clocks.

#### checkpoint

```conf
checkpoint = null
```

Optional and individual checkpoint. If you going to provide it , set height and corresponding block header id like

```
checkpoint = {
    height = 703848
    blockId = "ed64513030a0396f492385410ba643bb24ca69f0a72b83c9bae8f04d1fa9c5cd"
}
```
   
- Before the height given (including it) validation of scripts is missed.
- This improving perfomance and memory usage during initial bootstrapping.
- The node still applying transactions to UTXO set and so checks UTXO set digests for each block.
- Block at checkpoint height is to be checked against expected one.
    

#### adProofsSuffixLength

Dump `ADProofs` only for the suffix given during bootstrapping

```conf
adProofsSuffixLength = 114688 // 112k
```

```

User profile is about ordinary planned usage.

Exchange consumes ~20 MB of RAM for high-load ready Bloom filters

AppServer is in between

Put any non-zero value here to vote for soft-fork, or zero to vote against.

`120 = 0`

Put an array of rules to deactivate with the soft-fork
