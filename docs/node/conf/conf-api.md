# API Dispatcher Configuration

The `api-dispatcher` configuration controls the dispatcher responsible for managing API-related actors. In actor-based systems, the dispatcher is responsible for the execution of messages from the actor's mailbox.

## Dispatcher Type

```conf
type = Dispatcher
```

The `type` setting specifies the dispatcher type. In this configuration, `Dispatcher` is used, representing an event-based dispatcher.

## Executor Type

```conf
executor = "fork-join-executor"
```

The `executor` setting determines the type of execution service used. Here, the `fork-join-executor` is utilized, which allows tasks to be split into smaller parts and executed concurrently, increasing efficiency.

## Fork-Join Executor

### Minimum Parallelism

```conf
parallelism-min = 1
```

The `parallelism-min` setting indicates the minimum number of threads to cap the factor-based parallelism number.

### Parallelism Factor

```conf
parallelism-factor = 2.0
```

The `parallelism-factor` setting is used to calculate the parallelism, i.e., the number of threads. It is calculated as the ceiling of the number of available processors multiplied by the factor.

### Maximum Parallelism

```conf
parallelism-max = 2
```

The `parallelism-max` setting determines the maximum number of threads to cap the factor-based parallelism number.

## Throughput

```conf
throughput = 4
```

The `throughput` setting defines the maximum number of messages processed per actor before the thread switches to the next actor. A lower value results in fairer, but potentially less efficient execution. Here, it's set to 4.

## Full Code Snippet

```conf
api-dispatcher {
  type = Dispatcher
  executor = "fork-join-executor"
  fork-join-executor {
    parallelism-min = 1
    parallelism-factor = 2.0
    parallelism-max = 2
  }
  throughput = 4
}
```

Overall, the `api-dispatcher` configuration plays a crucial role in controlling the efficiency and fairness of processing messages for API-related actors in your application.
