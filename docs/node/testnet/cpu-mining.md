# CPU Mining

/// admonition | Warning!
    type: warning
Please do not GPU mine the testnet! It prevents CPU miners from winning any blocks and then leaves a high difficulty when you stop.

## Getting Set-up
>
> Please refer to [node](install.md) for basic node set-up up to this point.

To CPU mine on the testnet, your `testnet.conf` should look like this.

```conf
  ergo {
    networkType = "testnet"

    node {
      mining = true
      useExternalMiner = false
    }
  }

  scorex {

  network {
      bindAddress = "0.0.0.0:9022"
      nodeName = "ergo-testnet"
      #knownPeers = []
    }

  restApi {
      # Hex-encoded Blake2b256 hash of an API key. Should be 64-chars long Base16 string.
      # Below is hash corresponding to API_KEY = "hello" (with no quotes)
      apiKeyHash = "324dcf027dd4a30a932c441f365a25e86b173defa4b8e58948253471b81b72cf"
    }
  }
```

Then run

```
java -jar -Xmx4G ergo-*.jar --testnet -c testnet.conf
```

Make sure your wallet is initialised and unlocked, providing you're fully syncronised you should see an output like this indicating that you are mining.

```

Your rewards will be sent to your `rewardPublicKey`, which is different from your wallet address.

```
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:9052/mining/rewardPublicKey" -H  "accept: application/json"
```

/// admonition | Keep in mind
Please note that blocks take 720 confirmations on Ergo.
