#  Node Troubleshooting Guide

This document aims to help you troubleshoot common issues with the Ergo reference client. If you encounter a problem not covered here, please create a [new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/issues/new/choose) and provide the following details:

- Node version
- Java command used
- RAM/CPU specification
- Operating System
- JVM version
- Storage location (Cloud, SSD, etc)
- output of ERROR/WARN

You can obtain the output of ERROR/WARN by executing the following command:

```bash
tail -Fn+0 ergo.log | grep 'ERROR\|WARN' > output.log
```

## Searching the Logs

The following commands can help you search your logs for specific entries:

```bash
tail -Fn+0 ergo.log | grep 'ERROR\|WARN'
tail -Fn+0 ergo.log | grep 'ERROR'
tail -Fn+0 ergo.log | grep "not modified"
tail -Fn+0 ergo.log | grep ERR
tail -Fn+0 ergo.log | grep xception
tail -Fn+0 ergo.log | grep "stuck"
```

## Synchronization Issues

There are common problems that may occur during synchronization.

### Stuck on 'Active Synchronization'

If your node is stuck on Active Synchronization without a noticeable increase in height, try the following steps:

1. Use the log commands from above to see if there is anything noticeably wrong.
2. Shut down your instance, take a backup, and try to restart.
3. Join the [#node](https://discord.gg/jjRP2uNAv5) channel on Discord for support or open an issue on GitHub.

### Node Appears 'Synchronised' Even When It Isn't

If your node appears synchronised even though the height doesn't match the latest one found on the [explorer](https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/), you can add this to your `.conf` file under `ergo { node {`:

```conf
# A node is considering that the chain is synced if sees a block header with timestamp no more
# than headerChainDiff blocks on average from future
# 800 blocks ~= 1600 minutes (~1.1 days)
# headerChainDiff = 80
```

You might also be experiencing a [header downloading problem during synchronization](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/issues/1657).

### Lowering `maxConnections` 

To alleviate some performance issues on later blocks, you can lower the default `maxConnections` from 30 to 10 in your `ergo.conf`:

```bash
network {
    maxConnections = 10
}
```

This makes the sync process slower but it should run more smoothly.

### Reverting Without Resyncing

The latest versions of the node will attempt to fix any errors on their own, but if it fails, there is no way to manually roll back.

### Resyncing From Scratch

To resync, remove the following two directories and restart the node:

```bash
rm -rf .ergo/state
rm -rf .ergo/history
```

## Wallet Issues

### Correct Address/Balance Not Displayed

If your correct address or balance isn't displayed, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the wallet is synchronised.
2. Try to derive new addresses as per the [swagger](swagger.md) instructions.
3. Ensure you derived additional addresses during the sync process.
4. If the problem persists, restore the wallet on a different client.

## Common Error Messages

### 'Unable to Define External Address'

If you see this warning:

```
WARN [tor.default-dispatcher-11] s.c.n.NetworkController - 
Unable to define external address.
Specify it manually in `scorex.network.declaredAddress`
```

it means you aren't running a public node. You can ignore this warning.

### 'Got GetReaders Request in State None'

This error message is normal in the first few minutes of starting the node:

```
WARN  [ergoref-api-dispatcher-9] 
o.e.n.ErgoReadersHolder 
Got GetReaders request in state (None,None,None,None)
```

If you continue to receive this message, it likely indicates database corruption, which can be caused by unexpected shutdowns. To resync, remove the directories `.ergo/state` and `.ergo/history`, then restart the node.

### 'Invalid Z Bytes'

This error is related to parsing the `z` value for this constructor: `UncheckedSchnorr(dl, None, challenge, SecondDLogProverMessage(z))`.

To view the log entries surrounding this error, use the following command:

```bash
cat ergo.log | grep -A 30 -B 30 "Invalid z bytes"
```

### 'Dead Letters'

In Akka, messages that cannot be delivered are routed to an actor with the path `/deadLetters`. Dead letters do not necessarily indicate a problem but are logged by default for caution.

To search for these messages, use the following command:

```bash
tail -Fn+0 ergo.log | grep "akka.log-dead-letters"
```

### 'Failed to Connect to localhost Port 9053: Connection Refused'

You can use these commands to troubleshoot:

```bash
netstat -ln | grep 9053
sudo netstat -tulpn
```

### 'Tree Root Should Be Real'

This error typically means you're trying to sign a box that you don't own (i.e., you don't have the private key needed to sign).

## Issues with Public Nodes

While running your own node provides the most control and trust, many users rely on public nodes (like those listed on [ergonodes.net](https://ergonodes.net/list) or public API instances mentioned elsewhere in the docs) for convenience. If you encounter issues with a public node (e.g., incorrect data from indexed endpoints, API timeouts, connectivity problems):

1.  **Try a Different Public Node:** The simplest first step is to switch your wallet or application to use a different public node from the available lists. The issue might be specific to the node you were initially using.
2.  **Check Node Status:** Websites like [ergonodes.net](https://ergonodes.net/list) often show basic status information (height, sync status) for listed nodes. Check if the node you're having trouble with is reported as being out of sync or offline.
3.  **Identify the Operator (If Possible):** Some public nodes might be run by known community projects or individuals. If you can identify the operator, you might find specific support channels (Discord, Telegram) where you can report the issue directly.
4.  **Report in Community Channels:** If the operator is unknown or the issue seems widespread, report the problem in general Ergo community support channels (like the [#node](https://discord.gg/jjRP2uNAv5) channel on Discord). Provide details:
    *   The IP address or URL of the public node.
    *   The specific issue encountered (e.g., "API endpoint /blockchain/indexed/transaction/{txIndex} returning 404 for known index", "Node not responding", "Incorrect balance reported").
    *   The time the issue occurred.
    *   Any relevant transaction IDs or addresses if applicable.
5.  **Understand Limitations:** Public nodes are shared resources and may have unannounced downtime, performance limitations (unofficial rate limits), or occasional indexing issues (especially if using the `extraIndex` feature). For critical applications, running your own node is always recommended.
