# Ergo Node Protocol

The Node Protocol section provides a comprehensive overview of the core operational aspects of the Ergo network. It covers the following key areas:

- **Processing Algorithm**: This section explains the algorithm used for processing Ergo [modifiers](modifiers-validation.md). It is applicable across all security modes within the Ergo network, ensuring consistent data processing.

- **Validation Rules**: This part outlines the consensus-critical [validation](modifiers-validation.md) rules. These rules are mandatory for every node in the Ergo network to maintain network integrity and security. They ensure that all transactions and blocks adhere to the established network standards.

- **P2P Protocol**: The [P2P Protocol](../dev/p2p/index.md) section delves into the peer-to-peer protocol used in the Ergo network. It provides insights into how nodes communicate and share information, facilitating efficient data exchange within the network.

- **Peer Management**: The [peer management](peer-management.md) section discusses the strategies nodes in the Ergo network employ to manage their peers. It includes information about peer discovery, connection, and disconnection, providing a clear understanding of how nodes maintain network connectivity.

By understanding these aspects, you can gain a deeper insight into how the Ergo network operates, ensuring its security and efficiency.
