# Overclocking for Ergo Mining

Overclocking your GPU can help maximize your mining performance. However, it's important to proceed with caution as overclocking can increase power consumption and potentially shorten the lifespan of your hardware.

Here are some resources that provide overclocking settings shared by the mining community:

- [Community Overclocking Settings](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvRg_I5QumCBmMCwOHzel6bt5OOAA0uvJl_PBdKEtlpbRnVQ/viewform): This Google Form collects overclocking settings from the Ergo mining community. You can view the responses to get an idea of what settings others are using.

- [Hashrate.no](https://hashrate.no/coins/ERG): This website provides information about different cryptocurrencies, including Ergo. It includes a section on overclocking settings.

- [Kryptex Overclocking Database](https://www.kryptex.com/en/overclocking?device=all&algo=autolykos2&order=rating): Kryptex provides a database of overclocking settings for different GPUs and algorithms, including Autolykos2, which is used by Ergo.

Remember, every GPU is unique, and what works for others might not work for you. Always monitor your hardware's temperature and stability after applying new overclocking settings.
