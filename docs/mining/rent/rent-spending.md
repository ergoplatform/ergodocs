# How to Spend an Expired Ergo Box

Spending an expired Ergo box involves satisfying specific conditions that differ from spending a regular box. The following criteria must be met:

## Conditions for Spending an Expired Box

1. **Storage Fee Duration**: The box must have been retained for at least the designated storage fee period. This is validated by calculating the difference between the height of the upcoming block, as indicated in the preheader, and the creation height of the box. This difference should be greater than or equal to the storage fee period.
2. **Spending Proof**: For an expired box, the spending proof must be left empty, eliminating the need for cryptographic authorization for the box's spending.
3. **Storage Rent Awareness**: If the expired box is affected by storage rent, it must be processed through the appropriate storage rent mechanism. The storage rent endpoint must be queried to ensure compliance with Ergoâ€™s storage rent rules.

### Code Snippet for Verifying Storage Fee Duration

The following line of code checks whether the box has been stored for the required minimum duration, comparing the height of the upcoming block (`context.preHeader.height`) with the box's creation height (`context.self.creationHeight`):

```scala
context.preHeader.height - context.self.creationHeight >= Constants.StoragePeriod
```

**Reference**: [ErgoInterpreter.scala, line 73](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/49b9f0fe7d0eba1a5ff81e524353acdd9a3cc6dd/ergo-wallet/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/wallet/interpreter/ErgoInterpreter.scala#L73)

### Spending Proof for Expired Boxes

The term "spending proof" typically refers to a cryptographic authorization required for spending a box. However, in the context of an expired box, this requirement is waived. The spending proof for the expired box must be empty, meaning that no cryptographic validation is needed to authorize its spending. This allows any participant to spend the expired box without needing to prove ownership, as long as the storage fee duration condition is fulfilled.

### Additional Details for Spending an Expired Box

If both the above conditions are met, the expired box can be spent by anyone. To do so, one needs to provide an index of a newly recreated box (or an index of any box, if the expired box lacks sufficient funds for the storage fee) in the context extension variable #127, which will be stored as part of the input.

### Storage Rent-Specific Handling

1. **Custom Block Candidate Endpoint**

   * Miningcore introduces support for querying custom block candidates that include expired boxes.
   * This is done via a configurable `SrUrl`, which must point to an external service exposing a `/blocks/query` endpoint.
   * This service is not part of the official Ergo node and must be implemented separately.

2. **Integration with Mining Pools**

   * Mining pools using [this fork of Miningcore](https://github.com/K-Singh/miningcore-SR) can use `MiningRequestSRBlockCandidateAsync()` to fetch candidate blocks that account for expired boxes.
   * This enables pools to mine transactions that reclaim storage rent from old, unspent boxes.

3. **Implementation in ErgoClient**

   * The `ErgoClient` class was updated to accept a separate `SrUrl` base address, which it uses only when calling `MiningRequestSRBlockCandidateAsync()`.
   * This method builds a request to `GET {SrUrl}/blocks/query`, expecting a response in the same format as a regular Ergo mining candidate.
   * The actual service must be custom-built to return valid `WorkMessage` objects with expired box logic included.

4. **Spending an Expired Box Affected by Storage Rent**

   * If an expired box lacks sufficient ERG to cover the required storage rent fee, the transaction must reference an additional input box.
   * This box must provide enough value to pay the rent or satisfy pool policy for transaction acceptance.
   * This mechanism ensures that outdated UTXOs do not remain in the state indefinitely and that rent is either paid or reclaimed.

### Summary

With these changes, expired Ergo boxes can be properly mined and spent under storage rent conditions. While the Ergo node enforces storage rent rules during validation, external tooling (like custom candidate services) must be developed to support their inclusion in mining workflows.
