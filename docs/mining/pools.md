# Mining Pools

Mining pools are groups of miners who combine their computational resources to increase their chances of finding a block. The reward is then split among the pool members, proportional to the amount of work they contributed. 



/// admonition | Distribute your hashrate! Keep Ergo decentralised!
    type: warning
Please distribute your hashrate and mine towards smaller pools! A comprehensive list of Ergo mining pools is available on [Mining Pool Stats](https://miningpoolstats.stream/ergo).

## Earnings and Pool Size

While larger pools win blocks more frequently and can provide more consistent payouts, your long-term earnings should be roughly the same regardless of the pool size. In smaller pools, you might not receive a payout until the pool wins a block.

## Dual Mining

Dual mining allows you to mine Ergo alongside other coins such as KAS and ALPH. [Mining Pool Stats](https://miningpoolstats.stream/ergo) provides details on pools currently offering this feature natively.

## Solo Mining

Solo mining is an option for those who wish to operate independently of mining pools. This requires setting up a node and stratum server, which can be done by following the instructions provided in our [guide](pool.md).

Several mining pools offer a solo port for those who prefer this method. A comprehensive list of these pools can be found on [Mining Pool Stats](https://miningpoolstats.stream/ergo).

### SmartPools

[SmartPools](smartpools.md) are a decentralized alternative to traditional mining pools. They replace centralized mining pools with autonomous on-chain smart contracts. Keep an eye on [Lithos Protocol](lithos.md) for the next generation of mining.
