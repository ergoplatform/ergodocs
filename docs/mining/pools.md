# Mining Pools

Mining pools are groups of miners who combine their computational resources to increase their chances of finding a block. The reward is then split among the pool members, proportional to the amount of work they contributed. 

A comprehensive list of Ergo mining pools is available on [Mining Pool Stats](https://miningpoolstats.stream/ergo). 


## Earnings and Pool Size

While larger pools win blocks more frequently and can provide more consistent payouts, your long-term earnings should be roughly the same regardless of the pool size. In smaller pools, you might not receive a payout until the pool wins a block.

## Dual Mining

Dual mining allows you to mine Ergo alongside other coins such as KAS and ALPH. [Mining Pool Stats](https://miningpoolstats.stream/ergo) provides details on pools currently offering this feature natively.

## Solo Mining

Solo mining is an option for those who wish to operate independently of mining pools. This requires setting up a node and stratum server, which can be done by following the instructions provided in our [guide](pool.md).

Several mining pools offer a solo port for those who prefer this method. A comprehensive list of these pools can be found on [Mining Pool Stats](https://miningpoolstats.stream/ergo).

## Resources

- [Nice Hash](https://www.nicehash.com/) is a popular platform for cryptocurrency mining and trading that supports Ergo. They hosted a live event with Ergo, which you can watch [here](https://www.nicehash.com/blog/post/join-us-live-with-ergo-on-nice-talk-on-the-29th).

> Please do not mine to mining pools with large hashrate. Any pool close to 51% of the total network is at risk of an attack.

### SmartPools

[SmartPools](smartpools.md) are a decentralized alternative to traditional mining pools. They replace centralized mining pools with autonomous on-chain smart contracts. Keep an eye on [Lithos Protocol](lithos.md) for the next generation of mining.
