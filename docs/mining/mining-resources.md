# Mining Resources

This page provides a collection of resources related to Ergo mining. It includes academic papers, code repositories, test vectors, and discussion threads.

## Academic Papers

- [Ergo White Paper](https://www.docdroid.net/mcoitvK/ergopow-pdf): This paper provides a comprehensive overview of Ergo, including its design principles, consensus algorithm, and economic model.

- [Ergo Yellow Paper](https://www.docdroid.net/mcoitvK/ergopow-pdf): The Yellow Paper offers a more technical perspective on Ergo, detailing the platform's underlying algorithms and data structures.

- ["Bypassing Non-Outsourceable Proof-of-Work Schemes Using Collateralized Smart Contracts"](https://ia.cr/2020/044): This paper discusses a novel approach to bypassing non-outsourceable proof-of-work schemes using smart contracts.

## Code

The [Ergo GitHub repository](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/tree/master/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/mining) contains the Scala files related to Ergo's mining algorithm. This is a great resource if you're interested in understanding the technical details of Ergo mining.

## Test Vectors 

- [Test vectors for increased N values](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/test-vectors-for-increased-n-values/2887/2): This forum post provides test vectors for Ergo's proof-of-work algorithm with increased N values.

## EIPs

- [EIP27](eip27.md)
- [EIP37](eip37.md)
