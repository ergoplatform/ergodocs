# Building a Mining Rig

Building a mining rig for Ergo requires several components. Each component plays a crucial role in the mining process. Here's a list of the components you'll need and some resources to help you choose the right ones.

## Components

- [Graphics Card (GPU)](https://ergonaut.space/en/Guides/Mining/Graphics_Cards): The GPU is the most important component of a mining rig. It's responsible for solving the complex mathematical problems that validate transactions on the Ergo network.
- Motherboards (MOBO): The motherboard is the main circuit board of your mining rig. It's where all other components are connected.
- Power Supply (PSU): The power supply provides electricity to your mining rig. Make sure to choose a PSU with enough capacity to support all your components.
- Processor (CPU): While not as important as the GPU for mining, the CPU handles the rest of your rig's operations.
- Memory (RAM): RAM is your rig's short-term memory. It temporarily stores data that your CPU uses while operating.
- Storage (USB, SSD, HDD): Your rig's storage is where the operating system and mining software are installed.
- Other Hardware
  - GPU Risers: These allow you to connect multiple GPUs to your motherboard.
  - CPU Cooler: This keeps your CPU's temperature down.
  - Mining Rack: A mining rack helps you organize your rig in a safe and efficient manner.
  - Fans: Fans are necessary to keep your rig's temperature down.
