# Hosting a Pool on Ergo

To host your a pool on Ergo, you must first set up a local instance of the Ergo [node](solo-node.md), which should then point to your pool software ([Miningcore](../miningcore) or [Ergo Stratum Server](stratum.md)) with either the [NV](https://https://github.com/mhssamadani/Autolykos2_NV_Miner) or [AMD](https://github.com/mhssamadani/Autolykos2_AMD_Miner) miner
