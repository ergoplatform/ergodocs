# Hosting a Pool on Ergo

Hosting a pool on Ergo involves setting up a local instance of the Ergo node and configuring it to point to your pool software. This guide will walk you through the process step by step.

## Step 1: Set Up the Ergo Node

First, you need to set up a local instance of the Ergo node. You can find detailed instructions on how to do this [here](solo-node.md).

You will need to include the EIP27 rules mentioned on [this page](solo-node.md) to be able to spend your ERG.

## Step 2: Choose Your Pool Software

Next, you need to choose your pool software. Ergo supports two options: [Miningcore](miningcore.md) and [Ergo Stratum Server](stratum.md). Choose the one that best suits your needs.

## Step 3: Configure Your Miner

Finally, you need to configure your miner to point to your pool software. Depending on your hardware, you can use either the [NV](https://https://github.com/mhssamadani/Autolykos2_NV_Miner) or [AMD](https://github.com/mhssamadani/Autolykos2_AMD_Miner) miner.
