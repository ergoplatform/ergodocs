# Start Mining

This guide will walk you through the process of starting to mine Ergo using [Autolykos2](autolykos.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you start mining, make sure you have the following:

- Familiarity with Ergo. If you're new, start with [What is Ergo?](why.md)
- A computer with at least one GPU that has more than 6GB of memory. Check the [Autolykos v2 hashrates spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NsuoDB27EwCo_BlSjCP3GMLfTSJRPIWIBsL-wPTllUg) for potential hashrates.
- If you're considering building a dedicated rig, refer to our guide on [Building a rig](rig.md).

## Steps to Start Mining

1. Choose your preferred [mining software](software.md). If you're using a dedicated rig, select an appropriate [operating system](os.md).
2. Set up a [wallet](wallets.md) where your mining payouts will be deposited.
3. Select a [mining pool](pools.md) to join or look into [solo mining](solo.md)
4. Consider [overclocking](overclocking.md) your GPU to maximize your mining performance. Be aware that this can increase power consumption and potentially shorten the lifespan of your hardware.
5. Check out the [Miner Tooling](miner-tooling.md) and keep an eye on ways to participate in [miner governance](governance.md) in future.

Happy mining!
