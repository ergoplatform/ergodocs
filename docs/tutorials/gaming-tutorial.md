## How to Start Your Cyberverse Journey



- **Acquire $CYPX**: The journey begins with purchasing a small amount of $CYPX, the in-game currency and project token. This initial step is crucial for logging in and participating in the game. For more details on $CYPX and its utility, refer to the Cyberpixel Token Litepaper.

- **Obtain a Playable Character**: Citizens are playable NFTs with multiple utilities such as upcoming staking inside the game.  Players have two options to get started with their character in Cyberia:
   1. **Minting**: Log into [playcyberverse.com](http://playcyberverse.com) with your $CYPX, navigate to "In-game balance," and transfer 15 $ERG to your in-game wallet to mint your own Cybercitizen.

## Maximizing Your Gains: Staking Rewards


### CYPX Mining

[CYPX Mining](https://cyberverse.fandom.com/wiki/CYPX_Mining) is one of the passive game mechanics and ways to earn CYPX.

### Staking Your NFTs for $CYPX

In the CyberVerse, your NFTs are not just digital collectibles; they're assets that work for you. By staking your CyberVerse_io NFTs, you can earn $CYPX rewards, enhancing your in-game wealth and enabling further exploration and investment within CyberCity. Each CyberCitizen NFT you possess increases your daily $CYPX earnings, making every NFT a valuable asset in your digital portfolio.

### Claiming Your Staking Rewards

The bank feature within CyberCity serves as your hub for collecting the fruits of your staking endeavors. Here, you can manage your NFT assets efficiently and reap the rewards of your strategic investments.

To dive deeper into the mechanics of staking and maximize your earnings, explore the [Staking Guide](https://docs.cyberversegame.io/cyberverse-whitepaper/cyberverse-guide/bank), your roadmap to successful staking within the CyberVerse.



## MiniGames

The **Barman Minigame** involves working as a bartender in a club, where the goal is to fulfill all drink orders promptly. To start the minigame, players must talk to the club manager located in the upper area of the club. Each play costs 1 stamina and lasts for 2 minutes. Performance is tracked on a leaderboard, with daily rewards given based on tier achievement and additional rewards for the top three players: 

- 1st PLACE = 200 CYPX + Rewards from the tier list
- 2nd PLACE = 150 CYPX + Rewards from the tier list
- 3rd PLACE = 100 CYPX + Rewards from the tier list


Each job mini-game has its own leaderboard and reward tiers. All rewards are distributed once per day after the countdown on reset.
