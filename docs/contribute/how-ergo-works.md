# How Ergo Works

Ergo is permissionless and plural. No one owns the network. This page explains how control and change work in practice, then points you to action paths in [Contribute](contribute.md).

## The network at a glance

* No central owner, miners and full nodes enforce rules in code.

* Protocol updates need a majority of hash rate and clear user choice of chain.

* Permissionless action, anyone can build, launch, and compete.

* Social channels are centralized by nature, the owner controls access and content.

* The ecosystem is diverse, it includes companies, nonprofits, DAOs, and individual operators.

## Who controls what

* **Protocol rules:** miners and full nodes signal, enforce, and pick the chain.

* **Code repositories:** maintainers review, merge, and release per repo.

* **Wallets and apps:** product teams ship and users install, use, and rate.

* **Explorers and infrastructure:** operators and funders set uptime, features, and reach.

* **Media and chats:** channel owners set listings, moderation, and audience policy.

## How change moves from idea to adoption

**Technical track**

* State the problem and the rule or product you want.

* Ship a prototype or a reference build and show user gains with numbers.

* Provide tests, benchmarks, and a clear roll back plan.

* Use testnet and gather results from miners, nodes, wallets, and power users.

* Publish release notes and migration steps and watch the rollout.

**Social track**

* Map stakeholders across miners, node operators, wallet teams, explorers, indexers, market makers, and community leads.

* Tell a simple story that names user pain, the change, the benefit, and the risk control.

* Show demand with user numbers, miner interest, partner pilots, and testimonials.

* Recruit champions with public support from credible operators and builders.

* Run outreach inside owner controlled channels and inside your own channels.

* Ask for commitment signals such as miner tags, testnet participation, pool or wallet readiness, and user sign ups.

* Offer options if pushback appears and keep a civil tone.

## Centralized channels and moderation

* Channel owners control what appears on their platforms.

* Ask for listings with a short factual pitch and proof of users.

* If a request fails, use your own channels and grow with steady updates and real users.

* No spam and no brigading and follow local law and platform rules.

## Signals that matter

* Code that runs and improves user outcomes.

* Usage on testnet and in production.

* Miner and pool signals.

* Wallet and explorer readiness.

* Clear docs, reproducible builds, and visible support after release.
