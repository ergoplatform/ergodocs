# Funding Opportunities

We suggest that your initial step should be to launch a [Raffle](https://ergoraffle.com/). A Raffle not only provides a clear funding goal, but it also validates the community's support and can be supplemented by additional grant or foundation funding.

For projects of a larger scale, multiple grant programs are at your disposal. You can seek funding through the [Good Whale Fund](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues/13) or the [DarkFund0](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues/1). These platforms offer you the opportunity to introduce your project to the community, highlighting its potential impact and significance.

If you favor a more direct approach or if your project has unique needs that are not catered to by these platforms, you can send your grant request directly to us. Reach out to our team at [team@ergoplatform.org](mailto:team@ergoplatform.org) with your proposal.
