1. Draft an email to team@ergoplatform.org detailing your claim.
2. Make sure to include all relevant details in your email, such as the platform where the bounty was announced or a reference to this page for the mentioned bounties.

### Educational Reward Program

The Educational Reward Program is designed to stimulate the creation of educational content that benefits the Ergo community. We believe in the power of knowledge-sharing and empowerment as key drivers of growth. If you have educational content, even if it's not explicitly mentioned here, it could still be eligible for a reward. We invite you to contribute any educational materials that can enrich learning experiences.

At present, we are actively rewarding contributions to Developer Tutorials and Guides. These rewards are open to contributors of all skill levels. If you have valuable insights or knowledge to share, you can submit your educational contributions directly to our documentation repository. Visit [this link](https://github.com/glasgowm148/ergodocs) to make your valuable contributions.

### Development Reward Program

The Development Reward Program is our way of acknowledging and appreciating significant contributions to the Ergo repositories. If your contributions have significantly enhanced the development and improvement of the Ergo ecosystem, you could be eligible for a reward. You can find the details and guidelines for this program [here](https://github.com/ErgoDevs/Ergo-Bounties).

We deeply appreciate the time, dedication, and expertise you invest in enhancing our ecosystem. By participating in our mission to improve educational materials and drive development within the Ergo community, you are playing a crucial role in the collective growth and success of the platform.
