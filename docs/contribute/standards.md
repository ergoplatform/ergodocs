 **3.1** | Enable [OrgRobot](https://tgdev.io/bot/orgrobot) with custom questions which has a few handy free bots like [daysandbox_bot](https://tgdev.io/bot/daysandbox_bot), [grep_robot](https://tgdev.io/bot/grep_robot) and @WikiRobot, which can be used to reiterate a message at a set interval. |
 **3.2** | The built-in spam protection should be sufficient if properly configured in `Server Settings -> Moderation -> Saftey Setup` make sure all protections are enabled. Under `Automod` you can define custom words to filter an example would be `.gd, .gg, @everyone, #Support, ✉️, ➡️, ➡, 🎟️, 👇, 👉, 🎁, 💌, 📨, 📩, 📪, 📭, 🆘, adminsupports, bch.gg, Create Ticket, dsc.gg, earn $, https://t.me, Open-Ticket, Raise a ticket, shrtm.nu, Support Ticket, supportservice`. Alternatively you can enable [Wickbot](https://wickbot.com/). |
