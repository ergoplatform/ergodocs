## Initial Allocation

The Ergo Foundation initially received an allocation of 4,330,776 ERG, which is equivalent to 4.43% of the total supply.

A significant portion of this Treasury has been expended for the benefit of the Ergo protocol and community. Even during periods of low ERG price, the Foundation continued to invest in order to foster and grow the Ergo ecosystem.

Additionally, the Treasury exchanged 1,782,615 ERG for [EFYT](efyt.md), a token issued on the Waves Platform in 2017 to build an early community through airdrops and raise funds before the Ergo mainnet launch.

After subtracting the 1,782,615 ERG exchanged for EFYT, the Ergo Foundation was left with 2,548,161 ERG, which is approximately 2.6% of the total supply.

| **Total Illiquid Assets** | | | $3,554,431 |
| **Total Assets** | | | $4,060,931 |

/// details | Liquid vs Illiquid Funds
     {type: warning, open: true}
The Ergo Foundation's treasury consists of both liquid and illiquid assets, providing a diverse portfolio to support the growth and development of the Ergo ecosystem. The liquid assets, such as ERG and BTC, can be readily utilized for various purposes, while the illiquid assets, like Gluon, SPF, and RSN tokens, are held strategically to avoid exerting downward pressure on these early-stage projects.

As these projects mature and their tokens become more liquid, the Ergo Foundation will have the opportunity to leverage these assets to further augment its expenditure capabilities and support the Ergo ecosystem more effectively.

## Historic Spending

The Ergo Foundation has spent the majority of the Treasury for the benefit of the protocol and community. Funds were even spent when the ERG price was low, as it was necessary to bootstrap the thriving community Ergo now boasts.

<!--TODO: Yearly figures don't add up to total difference between total allocation & spending, 90k difference, probably missed a tx -->
