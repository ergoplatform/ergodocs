## Initial Role of the Ergo Foundation
The Ergo Foundation's initial role was to bootstrap the Ergo ecosystem in the early years and build the necessary infrastructure to facilitate adoption, addressing the 'hard side' of Ergo. This has led to the vibrant ecosystem we see today, with:

- Over 300 community developers
- More than 100 active contributors in the weekly developer chat on Discord
- Hosting multiple [events](events-overview.md) annually
- Over 140 projects developing on Ergo (see [sigmaverse.io](https://sigmaverse.io) for an overview)
- Consistently ranked among the top 100 for development activity on [artemis.xyz](https://app.artemis.xyz/developer-activity?ecosystemValue=Ergo)

## The Future
As time progresses, the Ergo Foundation's importance should diminish, and responsibility should transition towards the community. This shift is essential for the ecosystem's strength and decentralization.

The Ergo Foundation may continue to exist indefinitely as a legal entity, primarily serving to mitigate counterparty risk in interactions with centralized entities. In the interim, it will continue to foster the development of applications and protocols that align with its foundational objectives:

- Promoting blockchain technology for societal benefit
- Advocating for truly decentralized infrastructure
- Upholding privacy as a fundamental human right

The optimal strategy involves diligent work and the development of robust infrastructure to accommodate potential liquidity shifts from existing systems. Emphasis should be placed on user security, privacy, and long-term resilience. While the timing and nature of these shifts cannot be precisely predicted or controlled, strategic positioning can prepare us for various outcomes.

The generous contributions from ecosystem projects to the Foundation's [treasury](ef-treasury.md) ensure its sustainability, enabling it to fulfill this mission until it becomes redundant.

### The Sigmanauts Program
The [Sigmanauts Program](sigmanauts.md) is a grassroots initiative aimed at empowering individuals to take ownership of Ergo and shape its future. The program was launched to build the required structures to pass the baton to the community, enabling individuals to take ownership and contribute to Ergo's development.
