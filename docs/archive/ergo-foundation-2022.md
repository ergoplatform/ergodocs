The Ergo Foundation (EF) is a non-profit foundation dedicated to advancing the adoption of Ergo. The Foundation's Treasury is sourced from a small portion of mined blocks during the first 2.5 years from Ergo's mainnet launch. This allocation amounted to 4,330,791.5 ERGs or 4.43% of the total supply.

## Mission

The Ergo Foundation is a community-driven entity focused on the following:

- Promoting non-breaking development of Ergo Platform protocol;
- Promoting the widespread adoption and use of the Ergo Platform and its native token (ERG);
- Developing the ecosystem around the Ergo Platform;
- Promoting the use of the Ergo Platform and blockchain technology for social good;
- Supporting truly decentralised infrastructure and;
- Supporting privacy as a basic human right.

Ergo Platform's primary focus is to provide an efficient and secure way to implement financial contracts, the most widely used application of blockchain technology. This focus is recognised and supported by the Ergo Foundation.

The Ergo Foundation is committed to organic and non-breaking development of the Ergo Platform protocol. The Foundation ensures that protocol changes are approved not only by miners - who express their will directly on the blockchain - but also by users and projects building on top of Ergo. 

The Ergo Foundation is committed to maximising the number of valuable ecosystem developments accomplished in open-source with the least permissive licence possible.

The Foundation is also dedicated to helping with building trustless environments, smart contracts and payment frameworks for the public with privacy in mind. The Foundation believes that the Treasury should be distributed mainly to the community, including freelancers, hackers, experts and enthusiasts.

## Scope

### Infrastructure
- Support for protocol research, development of the reference client, alternative clients (if needed),  libraries, and developer tooling. 
- Improving market access by getting Ergo on centralised exchanges, hardware wallets, bridges, or other means.

### Education

- Creating materials to educate developers and users directly or funding their creation through third parties from within the community. 

### Marketing

The Foundation aims to promote the adoption of Ergo. While its operations in this area are conservative, it does fund a select few roles in linear marketing via an editorial department for areas not currently met by the community.


The current roles outwith development consist of 

- Editorial Director
- Youtube Manager
- Editor
- Writers (via paid bounties)
- Chinese Community Manager
- Graphics Support

Their efforts ensure ample information is available about ongoing developments on Ergo via blog posts and social media, as well as the promoting and operating of various marketing events, such as Ergo Summit and ErgoHack.

Over the past 23 years, network effects have accounted for approximately 70% of the value creation in tech, and this figure is likely higher for a third-generation grassroots blockchain. While the EF strives to lay the foundations and help ignite community marketing and, subsequently, compounding growth, beyond this, the marketing and promotion of Ergo rest principally on the shoulders of the community. [(Get Involved!)](contribute.md)

The EF does not commonly pay for influencers or ad campaigns and does its best to restrict frivolous spending, which is deemed not cost-effective  (i.e. airdrops, giveaways).

The marketing department highlights projects building in the ecosystem. However, these initiatives do not constitute an endorsement from the Ergo Foundation. The Foundation will always use best practices to vet projects and ensure that there is no risk for potential users. Still, in the early stages of development, it is often unknowable if anything of substance will ultimately be produced.

### 'Core' Team

**There is no official 'core' team.** While some people working on Ergo day-to-day are salaried, many are volunteers, collecting bounties or working on their own projects on top of Ergo. Core Marketing can include keen community members alongside salaried workers. Similarly, anyone with significant contributions to core repositories can be invited to Core Development chats without being a salaried *employee*.





### Voting 

The Ergo Foundation members and officers discuss proposals before putting them to a formal vote on the ergoforum, passed with a majority of voting members. 

Before voting on spending treasury funds, we will approach the [Good Whale Fund](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-11-02-good-whales-grant-fund/), [DarkFund0](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/darkfund0-zk-fund-for-privacy-applications/398), or suggest creating a [Raffle](https://ergoraffle.com/) if appropriate.

### Relationship to Development

Relationships between the Foundation and development only exist when there is a demand not met by the community, and this role is diminishing over time. Some EF members also have developer positions, and while their development activities are not part of their foundation involvement, they are listed here for transparency. 

- Kushti manages any bounties relating to the reference client repository and keeps a watch over [sigma-rust](sigma-rust.md) development and any other high-level development and research not covered below.
- Morphic manages any JVM-related developers (Wallet devs, Scala devs, etc.) and the [sigmastate-interpreter](sigmastate-interpreter.md). 
- mhs_sam manages a team of graduates and PhD students who have produced [Ergo Raffle](ergoraffle.md), [ErgoWell](ergowell.md), [Minotaur-wallet](wallets.md), and [Rosen Bridge](rosen.md). 

### Activities

The average day-to-day for foundation members in 2022 mostly consisted of the continued effort of getting a bank account, incorporation, reincorporation, dealing with exchanges, market-makers and our internal accounting & budgeting. As well as overseeing the following activities:

- Salaries for contracted developers.
- Paying 'bounties' set on core repositories.
- Core protocol development.
- Wallet development.
- Exchange listings.
- Paying third parties for admin and miscellaneous expenses.
- Partnership-related expenses.
- Hackathon and summit-related expenses.
- Marketing and promotion-related costs. 


### Code Audits

The Ergo Foundation does not review or endorse any code specifically. Code reviews are sometimes performed by Ergo Foundation members (due to their expertise in this area), but this does not constitute an endorsement, and users should be aware of their assumptions when interacting with experimental DeFi protocols. (See - [*Know Your Assumptions*](kya.md))

### Exchanges

One of the primary reasons the Ergo Foundation exists is to act as a legal entity to deal with centralised exchanges. Since genesis, Ergo has been listed on several exchanges, including three *Tier 1* exchanges (KuCoin, gate.io, Huobi). 

A *tier 1* exchange is defined as an exchange that appears in the top 10 of exchange ranking sites such as [defillama.com/cexs](https://defillama.com/cexs)

Exchange discussions and details are always under Non-Disclosure Agreement ('NDA'). To clear up some misconceptions, we can release the following details.

- Listings are usually expensive. 
- Exchanges do not buy liquidity or any of the native tokens or coins on the open market generally. Instead, we use a third-party Market Maker ('MM'), which has access to an API with a preallocated amount of ERG and USDT it uses to create a liquid market. The MM can only buy/sell and lacks the credentials to withdraw assets. 
- All major exchanges have been approached, and the EF has not rejected any exchanges due to them being too expensive.   

**‘But why is coin x listed?’**

Possible reasons include the following:

- They are a native asset on an already integrated chain (i.e., ERC20, Cosmos, etc.). Therefore, very little work is required to add and maintain a new chain here.
- For Layer 1's:
    - Have venture-capitalist funding and connections, which they can utilise to get listed early. 
    - Have a smaller public distribution than ERG and can bargain with exchanges for a percentage of their total supply. 
    - Are less complex than Ergo, with no native asset support, no need to worry about UTXO dust, etc. 
    - They may be older than Ergo and were listed during the last bear. 
    - Even though they are a unique Layer-1, they may only have a wrapped asset (i.e., on BSC) listed. 

You can follow along on our [Weekly AMAs](https://www.youtube.com/@ErgoPlatform/streams) to catch any hints regarding the current exchange listing efforts. 

## Treasury

The initial allocation was 4,330,776 ERG, or 4.43% of the total supply. 

You can find the Ergo Foundation treasury and current balance [on-chain](https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/4L1ktFSzm3SH1UioDuUf5hyaraHird4D2dEACwQ1qHGjSKtA6KaNvSzRCZXZGf9jkfNAEC1SrYaZmCuvb2BKiXk5zW9xuvrXFT7FdNe2KqbymiZvo5UQLAm5jQY8ZBRhTZ4AFtZa1UF5nd4aofwPiL7YkJuyiL5hDHMZL1ZnyL746tHmRYMjAhCgE7d698dRhkdSeVy).

You can read more in the [emission](emission.md) section. 


### Historic Spending

The Ergo Foundation has spent the majority of the Treasury for the benefit of the protocol and community. Funds were even spent when the ERG price was low, as it was necessary to bootstrap the thriving community Ergo now boasts.

Salaries account for 70-90% of spending in most months, with the remainder in order of amounts usually being Bounties and Grants, Marketing expenses, and Administrative/General expenses. However, big one-off expenses, mainly exchange listings, lower this percentage substantially when looking at a longer time frame.

| Spent | ERG | USD |
|---|---|---|
| 2022  | 723,000 | $2,247,640.00 |
| 2021  | 889,001 | $3,793,485.00 |
| 2020  | 1,080,000 | $500,292.50 |
| 2019 | 757,051 | $590,239.31 |
| Total | 3,449,052 | $7,131,656.80 |



### Salaries

Twenty people receive monthly salaries or rewards for their contributions. The vast majority (16/20) were promoted from within the community after exceptional contributions. 

A monthly breakdown of long-term salary commitments is as follows:

- EF Members, Advisors and Officers: 6,320 ERG
- Marketing: 1,500 ERG + 7,000 USD
- Development: 5,600 ERG + 10,000 USD.

### Other commitments. 

Not included in the Salary section above are short-term commitments such as funding for Spectrum and Rosen in 2022. Full details will be given at a later date.


### Budgeting

Outgoings are reviewed consistently depending on price and more formally every 60-90 days. The EF reduced their outgoings by ~15% at the end of 2022 in response to market conditions. 

Please note that the Foundation's primary role is to **bootstrap** the ecosystem. There are funds for at least another 2-3 years, (excluding any development financiers and token allocations from ecosystem projects we may have in the pipeline).  


## The Ergo Foundations Future

The Foundation's role was to bootstrap the Ergo ecosystem in the initial years and build up the infrastructure required for adoption, solving the 'hard side' of Ergo and leading to the vibrant ecosystem we see today with:

- 300+ community devs
- 100+ Active contributors in the weekly dev chats
- 45 Hackathon participants in 2022 alone.
- 140+ projects are developing on Ergo.
- Stack consistently ranks Ergo as one of the highest in developer activity. 

As time goes on, the importance of the EF should diminish and shift towards the community entirely. This is essential for both the strength of the ecosystem and ensuring that Ergo is not classified as a security. 

The [Sigmanauts Programme](sigmanauts.md) was launched at the start of 2022 to fill this need and build the required structures to pass the baton to the community. 

The Ergo Foundation will likely exist for some time yet, and it may exist in some form for perpetuity as a legal entity to take counterparty risk when dealing with centralised actors.

Alternatively, it could continue to exist as a research branch to encourage the development of applications and protocols which adhere to its original goals of supporting blockchain technology for social good, truly decentralised infrastructure and privacy as a basic human right. 

The best course of action is to grind and build infrastructure for when liquidity leaks or flees existing systems. Focus on user security assumptions, privacy and longer-term non-fragility. 

Not something we can necessarily force, time or predict, but we can position ourselves.
