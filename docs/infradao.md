# InfraDAO

InfraDAO is a community-driven initiative focused on funding, coordinating, and maintaining the critical infrastructure that powers the Ergo ecosystem. It complements the Ergo Foundation and DevDAO by concentrating on long-lived services and shared components needed by users, developers, miners, and dApps.

What InfraDAO supports:
- Core infra: explorers, public nodes, archival datasets, indexing backends, gateways, mirrors
- Network tooling: monitoring, metrics, health checks, snapshots
- Developer infra: CI/CD, package registries, build pipelines, doc hosting, code-quality tooling
- Security and reliability: backups, uptime SLAs, emergency response playbooks, incident reporting
- Community services: mirrors, docs, and utilities commonly used across the ecosystem

How it works:
- Transparent budgeting and clear scopes tied to specific infra deliverables
- Preference for open-source and reproducible deployments
- Vendor-neutral standards and handover documentation to minimize single points of failure
- Coordination with maintainers to align upgrades and reduce downtime
