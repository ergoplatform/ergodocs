## Can Celaut and Netnotes Be Used Together?  

Yes, they complement each other perfectly.

- **Netnotes** gives individuals full control over their personal financial strategies and automation agents.

For example:  

- A Netnotes automation agent can monitor portfolio conditions locally.  
- When specific market conditions are met, the agent can trigger advanced trading strategies hosted on Celautâ€™s decentralized network.  
- This combines local asset control with access to scalable, high-performance services that would be too resource-intensive to run on a personal device.
