# TabbyPOS

[TabbyPOS](https://tabbylab.io) is a comprehensive point-of-sale (POS) solution designed for merchants. It offers a range of features, including a merchant dashboard, a customer-facing interface, and a mobile app for remote management. The solution is scalable and can support various hardware devices, including cash registers, barcode scanners, and printers. TabbyPOS provides several security features, including end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, and a built-in fraud detection system. While the whitepaper does not explicitly state that TabbyPOS is designed to comply with various regulations, the security features and use of a secure blockchain may contribute to meeting some compliance requirements.
