# ErgOne

ErgOne ($Erg0ne) is an innovative token built on the Ergo blockchain that implements the Proof-of-Commitment Protocol (PoCoP) - a unique approach to incentivizing community engagement and ecosystem growth.

## How It Works

The PoCoP protocol rewards active participation in the Ergo ecosystem through:

- Creating and sharing content about Ergo
- Engaging with the community
- Contributing creative materials
- Voting on community content

Your contributions are measured by a Virality Score that ensures fair distribution of $Erg0ne token rewards.

3. Start submitting content and voting on community contributions
4. Earn $Erg0ne tokens based on your engagement
