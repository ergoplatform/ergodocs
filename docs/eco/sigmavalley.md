# SigmaValley

[SigmaValley](https://www.sigmavalley.org/) is the first metaverse on the Ergo blockchain; it aims to be a caricaturesque and up-to-date visualization of the Ergo ecosystem. It was inspired by the Silicon Valley TV series Intro, and it allows all Ergonauts to own one or more plots on SigmaValley and help determine its present and future.
