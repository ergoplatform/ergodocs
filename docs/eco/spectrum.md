# Spectrum Finance

[Spectrum](https://spectrum.fi) is a pioneering open-source, cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) platform, currently offering liquidity provision (LP), yield farming, and babel fees on the Cardano (ADA) and Ergo (ERG) networks.

## Current Features of Spectrum Finance

- **Liquidity Provision & Yield Farming**: Users can engage in liquidity provision and yield farming.
- **Babel Fees**: Babel fees allow transaction fees to be paid with various tokens.

## Spectrum Bloom: Next-Generation DeFi Framework

Spectrum Bloom is an upcoming eUTxO-native framework for decentralized finance (DeFi), designed to address and improve upon the limitations of early decentralized exchanges (DEXes). 

### Highlights from the Spectrum Bloom White Paper

- **Addressing Early DEX Limitations**: Spectrum Bloom aims to overcome issues such as lack of transparency, composability, and poor performance in early DEX implementations.
- **Decentralization and Openness**: The framework focuses on principles of decentralization, openness, transparency, and sustainability.
- **eUTxO Model**: Utilizes the eUTxO blockchain model, as seen in Ergo and Cardano, supporting multi-stage contracts and multi-token functionality.
- **Innovative DEX Protocol**: Includes a novel protocol for DEX that consists of both on-chain (UTxO and validators) and off-chain (event handlers for state transitions) elements.
- **Liquidity Pooling and Execution**: Spectrum Bloom proposes unique approaches to liquidity pooling and order execution, aiming to streamline processes and reduce overhead.
- **Universal Order Composition**: Introduces universally composable orders, which can be fulfilled from any liquidity source, enhancing flexibility and efficiency.
- **Autonomous Account (AA)**: A key feature where an on-chain entity can validate execution and release user funds for trading, facilitating a dynamic set of applications on eUTxO blockchains.
- **Future Extensions and Applications**: The white paper also discusses potential extensions and applications of the Autonomous Account concept beyond DEXes.
