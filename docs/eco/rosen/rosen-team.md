# Rosen Team

The Rosen team is comprised of 8 full-time developers and 2-3 part-time developers. Some frontend and UI tasks are outsourced. The team's strength is further enhanced by the support of several advisors.

Rosen Bridge operates entirely on self-funding, with no involvement of private sales, venture capital, or SAFT agreements. All contracts are financed out of pocket as there is no emission yet. The core team is made up of 6 main developers.

Initial liquidity for Ergo, accounting for 5%, was deposited on the Spectrum LP. This process was carried out without the involvement of bots or front-running. (Refer to the [Tokenomics](rosen-tokenomics.md) section for more details)

A collaboration was established with Zengate for Catalyst, as it involves Cardano politics, an area that falls within their realm of expertise.

The team has successfully completed and received funds from milestone 3 and has submitted milestone 4 for F10 funding.

## History

The Rosen Bridge team was initially assembled during [ERGOHACK I](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/events/ergohack/#ergohack-i). Under the mentorship of @mhs_sam, team members @RaaCT0R, @vorujack, and @zargarzadeh developed [ErgoRaffle](ergoraffle.md). This marked the beginning of their significant contributions to the ecosystem, which include projects like [minotaur-wallet](wallets.md) and ergo-faucet. The concept of a bridge has been a consistent focus for the team since 2021, initially with [ErgoGravity](https://github.com/ErgoGravity), an Ergo connector to the Wormhole bridge. However, after the Wormhole bridge was [compromised, resulting in a loss of $325m](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916111/wormhole-hack-github-error-325-million-theft-ethereum-solana), the team shifted their focus towards developing a bridge centered around Ergo.

## Is Rosen Bridge Affiliated with Ergo or The Ergo Foundation?

Rosen Bridge, although initiated by members of the Ergo Foundation, operates independently. The Ergo Foundation does not exercise any managerial or controlling influence over Rosen Bridge. However, the Foundation has provided support to Rosen Bridge in the form of grants, a common practice for projects within the ecosystem. The Foundation is also set to receive 3% of the total supply of RSN. For more details, refer to the [Tokenomics](rosen-tokenomics.md) section.
