# Bitcoin Rosen Bridge Watcher Setup

To participate as a watcher in the Rosen Bridge, you need to deploy a watcher app that observes one of the supported networks. Each supported network has its own set of watchers responsible for reporting users' actions on that specific network.

## Docker Setup

/// admonition | This section is adapted from the [deploy-docker.md](https://github.com/rosen-bridge/operation/blob/dev/docs/watcher/deploy-docker.md) section on the Rosen Bridge documentation.
    type: info
///

Clone the [Operation repository](https://github.com/rosen-bridge/operation.git) and navigate to the `operation/watcher` directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rosen-bridge/operation.git
cd operation/watcher/
```

Create your environment file `.env` based on the `env.template` file in the `watcher` directory:

```shell
cp env.template .env
```

To view hidden `.env` files later, use `ls -a`.

### Environment Variable Configurations

Configure the required environment variables in the `.env` file (ensure no spaces after the '=' sign):

```shell
# Required Environments

POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_random_password
POSTGRES_USER=your_random_username
POSTGRES_DB=your_random_db_name
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
```

Set the required permissions and create the `local.yaml` file in the `config` directory:

```shell
sudo chown -R 3000:3000 logs
touch config/local.yaml
```

For MacOS users, set `707` permission for the `logs` directory:

```shell
sudo chmod -R 707 logs
```

/// details | Note for Raspberry Pi ARM Users
{type: info, open: false}

To run the watcher on an ARM-based Raspberry Pi, use an ARM-based DB image. Update the `docker-compose.yml` as follows:

Change the DB image according to your architecture (e.g., `arm64v8`):

```diff
services:
  db:
-   image: rapidfort/postgresql:16.0.0
+   image: arm64v8/postgres:16.0
```

Update the volume of the DB:

```diff
    volumes:
-     - postgres-data:/bitnami/postgresql
+     - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
```

///

### Pull Docker Images and Run Service

Pull the Docker image:

```shell
docker compose pull
```

Set up your `local.yaml` using the instructions in the next section (Local Config). After saving the changes, run the container:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

## Local Config

To start your watcher, configure the `local.yaml` file.

### Specify the Target Network

Set the target network you're watching. Currently supported networks are `ergo`, `cardano`, and `bitcoin`:

```yaml
network: bitcoin
```

### API Configuration

```yaml
api:
  apiKeyHash: "YOUR_API_KEY_HASH"
```

To secure the action-based APIs (e.g., lock, unlock), set a unique and robust API key hash using the Blake2b algorithm. You can generate the hash using the [rosen command line](https://github.com/rosen-bridge/utils/tree/dev/packages/cli):

```shell
npx @rosen-bridge/cli blake2b-hash YOUR_API_KEY
```

Alternatively, use Docker:

```shell
docker run -it --rm node:18.16 npx --yes @rosen-bridge/cli blake2b-hash YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Bitcoin Configuration

Choose your information source for the Bitcoin network and specify its connection information.

You can use either `rpc`

```yaml
bitcoin:
  type: rpc
  rpc:
    url: "YOUR_RPC_URL"
    username: "YOUR_RPC_USERNAME"
    password: "YOUR_RPC_PASSWORD"
```

//// details | Setting Up a Bitcoin Node (RPC)
{type: info, open: false}
For optimal watcher performance and decentralization, running your own fully synced Bitcoin node is recommended. However, this consumes significant disk space, so you can use a public node as detailed in the next section.

1. Install Bitcoin Core following the [official instructions](https://bitcoin.org/en/download) for your OS.

2. Configure Bitcoin Core:

   - Locate the `bitcoin.conf` file in the Bitcoin data directory:
     - Linux: `~/.bitcoin/`
     - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/`
     - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Bitcoin\`
   - Open `bitcoin.conf` with a text editor or create it if it doesn't exist.

3. Generate an RPC username and password:

   - Visit [this RPC auth generator](https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-rpc-auth-generator)
   - Enter a username and click "Generate"
   - Copy the generated line starting with `rpcauth=`

4. Edit `bitcoin.conf` to enable the RPC server and allow the watcher to connect:

   - Paste the `rpcauth` line you copied
   - Add the following lines to enable the RPC server:

     ```bash
     server=1
     rpcbind=0.0.0.0
     rpcallowip=0.0.0.0/0
     txindex=1
     rest=1
     ```

   - To limit RPC access to only the watcher container, set `rpcallowip` to the Docker network range:

     ```bash
     rpcallowip=172.16.0.0/12
     ```

   - Save the file

5. If `bitcoind` was already running, stop and restart it:

   ```bash
   bitcoin-cli stop
   bitcoind -daemon
   ```

6. Verify the node is running and wait for it to sync:

   ```bash
   bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
   ```

   Look for `"initialblockdownload": false` to confirm the node is synced.

/// details | Running a Pruned Bitcoin Node
{type: info, open: false}
A pruned Bitcoin node is not compatible with the Rosen Bitcoin bridge watcher. The watcher requires the `txindex=1` setting, which is not supported by pruned nodes. If you initially synced a pruned node, you'll need to restart the sync with a full node.
///
/// details | Increasing Bitcoin Node DbCache
{type: info, open: false}
To speed up the initial sync of your Bitcoin node, increase the dbcache setting if you have sufficient RAM. For example, to allocate 4GB of cache, add the following line to your bitcoin.conf:

```conf
dbcache=4096
```

Adjust the value based on your available memory.
///
/// details | Current Bitcoin Blockchain Size
{type: info, open: false}
As of June 2024, the Bitcoin blockchain size is approximately 657GB. Keep this in mind when provisioning storage for your Bitcoin node.
///
/// details | Bitcoin Blockchain Snapshots
{type: info, open: false}
Some services provide Bitcoin blockchain snapshots to speed up the initial sync process. However, be cautious when using these snapshots, as they may not be compatible with the txindex=1 requirement for the Rosen Bitcoin watcher. Ensure that the snapshot is from a full node with transaction indexing enabled.
///
/// details | Monitoring Bitcoin Node Sync Progress
{type: info, open: false}
You can monitor the sync progress of your Bitcoin node using the `bitcoin-cli` command:

```bash
bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
```

Look for the `"verificationprogress"` field in the output. A value of `1.000000` indicates that the node is fully synced.
///
/// details | Using a Separate Machine for the Bitcoin Node
{type: info, open: false}
If you have limited resources on your watcher machine, consider running the Bitcoin node on a separate machine. This way, the resource-intensive block syncing process won't affect the performance of your watcher.

Update the `rpc.url` in your watcher's `local.yaml` to point to the remote Bitcoin node's IP address and RPC port:

```yaml
bitcoin:
  type: rpc
  rpc:
    url: "http://<user>:<password>@<remote-ip>:8332"
```

Make sure to configure the Bitcoin node's `rpcallowip` setting to allow connections from the watcher machine's IP.
///
/// details | Enabling Transaction Broadcasting
{type: info, open: false}
If you want your Bitcoin node to be able to broadcast transactions (not required for the watcher but useful for debugging), add the following line to your `bitcoin.conf`:

```conf
zmqpubrawtx=tcp://0.0.0.0:28332
```

This enables the ZeroMQ raw transaction broadcasting feature.
///
////

or `esplora`:

```yaml
bitcoin:
  type: esplora
  esplora:
    url: https://mempool.space
```

Set your watcher's initial height:

```yaml
initial:
  height: LATEST_BITCOIN_HEIGHT
```

Customize observation confirmation and validity threshold:

```yaml
observation:
  confirmation: 2
  validThreshold: 72
```

### Ergo Configuration

/// admonition | **Even if you are running a Bitcoin Watcher, you must configure the Ergo section**
    type: warning
///

Create a new wallet and set the wallet mnemonic, you can also load this through an environmental variable so it's only stored in-memory.

```yaml
ergo:
  mnemonic: "YOUR_WALLET_MNEMONIC"
```

Select your primary data source:

```yaml
ergo:
  type: node
  node:
    url: https://example.node.com
  explorer:
    url: https://api.ergoplatform.com
```

Set the initial height of your watcher:

```yaml
initialHeight: LATEST_HEIGHT
```

Customize observation confirmation and validity threshold:

```yaml
observation:
  confirmation: 10
  validThreshold: 720
```

### Example Configuration for Bitcoin Watcher

```yaml
network: bitcoin
api:
  apiKeyHash: "YOUR_API_KEY_HASH"
ergo:
  type: explorer
  initialHeight: LATEST_ERGO_HEIGHT
  mnemonic: "YOUR_WALLET_MNEMONIC"
  node:
    url: https://example.node.com
bitcoin:
  type: rpc
  rpc:
    url: "YOUR_BITCOIN_RPC_URL"
    username: "YOUR_RPC_USERNAME"
    password: "YOUR_RPC_PASSWORD"
  initial:
    height: LATEST_BITCOIN_HEIGHT
observation:
  confirmation: 2
  validThreshold: 72
```

## Get Your Watcher Permit

After setting up and running your watcher instance, access the watcher UI by visiting [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030). From your dashboard, you can view network information, assets, and health status alongside action buttons. To activate your watcher, proceed to the 'LOCK' action, where you can utilize assets from the watcher wallet for registration and obtain reporting permits. Top up your wallet with the specified amounts of ERG and RSN to receive these permits.

As a watcher, your primary responsibility is to monitor your network and report actions related to the bridge. To report a bridge event, you must have report permits. Acquiring these permits involves two types of payments:

1. **Collateral:** Provide one-time collateral in the form of ERG and RSN tokens to obtain initial report permits. This collateral serves as a security measure to mitigate Sybil attacks. When you return all your report permits, the collateral is refunded, and your watcher is unregistered.

2. **RSN for Permits:** Lock RSN tokens to receive permit tokens. Use these tokens to create report permits for reporting events. The number of report permits determines how many concurrent reports you can create. In the event of a valid report, the permit is refunded along with your reward. If the report is invalid, the permit is seized as a penalty.
