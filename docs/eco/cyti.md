# CYTI

[CYTI](https://github.com/ThierryM1212/cyti) is the acronym for Choose Your Token ID. The team built a ‘minable’ smart contract that will allow an entity “to mint tokens with a given character sequence at the beginning of the token ID. A token minter creates a CYTI request, and miners generate the proper token ID using the CYTI miner software. When one of the miners succeeds, [they receive] the fee from the CYTI contract and the token with the right token ID is sent to the token minter.”
