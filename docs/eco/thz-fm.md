# THz.FM

[THz.FM](https://thz.fm/) is an open-source framework to replace existing legacy media monetisation & management platforms. (Previously 'swamp-audio'). 

The goals are simple; to make life better for the artists/musicians, and to bring diverse ideas & people together to be something greater than the sum of their parts. Swamp is currently developing an open-source framework to replace existing legacy media monetisation & management platforms, harnessing the power of blockchain & Ergo.
