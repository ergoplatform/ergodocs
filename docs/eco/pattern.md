# Pattern: Explorer Co-Pilot & On-chain Model Context Registry

**Project for [ErgoHack 10: AI on the Ergo Blockchain](https://www.google.com/search?q=ergohack.md)**

### 1\. Introduction

Pattern is an on-chain Model Context Registry (MCR) supercharged with an open-source Orchestrated Multi-Agent System (OMAS)[cite: 1]. It aims to simplify blockchain data analysis by transforming raw data into structured knowledge in real-time. Functioning as an "explorer co-pilot," Pattern provides a faster way for users to make sense of blockchain information by instantly fetching and structuring data about transactions, addresses, and contracts[cite: 1].

### 2\. Key Concepts & Functionality

  * **On-chain Model Context Registry (MCR):** Pattern utilizes an on-chain MCR, which is a core component for its operation[cite: 1].
  * **Orchestrated Multi-Agent System (OMAS):** An open-source OMAS works to process and transform data into structured knowledge[cite: 1].
  * **"Explorer Co-pilot":** Pattern acts as a real-time "MCP for Ergo data," allowing users to ask questions and receive instant answers based on aggregated, contextual knowledge, eliminating the need to manually dig through explorers[cite: 1].
  * **Querying Capabilities:** The platform can fetch and structure information about transactions, addresses, and contracts on the fly, answering user queries instantly[cite: 1].
  * **Cross-chain Support:** Pattern supports multiple blockchain environments, including EVMs (Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum), Solana, and Ergo[cite: 1].

### 3\. Technical Details

Pattern's architecture is divided into core logic and a frontend application:

  * **Core Logic:** Handles the fundamental data processing and knowledge structuring.
  * **Frontend Application:** Provides the user interface for interacting with the Pattern system.

### 4\. Current Status & Progress (ErgoHack 10)

During ErgoHack 10, an alpha version of Pattern was made available for public testing[cite: 1]. Users can try the system without needing to connect a wallet or log in, as a new login flow is under development[cite: 1].

### 5\. Getting Started

You can check out and try the alpha version of Pattern directly:
