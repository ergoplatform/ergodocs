# ErgoNames: Decentralized Naming System for Ergo

ErgoNames is a decentralized naming system for the Ergo blockchain, allowing users to register human-readable names that can be associated with their Ergo addresses. This improves the user experience by making it easier to send and receive transactions using memorable names instead of long, complex addresses.

## Key Features

- Register unique names on the Ergo blockchain
- Associate registered names with Ergo addresses
- Resolve registered names to their corresponding addresses
- Support for subnames (e.g., alice.example)
- Decentralized and censorship-resistant
- Open-source and community-driven

ErgoNames is an important project for improving the usability and adoption of the Ergo ecosystem. By providing a user-friendly naming system, it reduces the friction of using Ergo addresses and enables a better overall experience for users.

## Project Overview

The project is actively being developed by the Ergo community, with contributions from various developers. The core components include:

- **Ergo Contracts**: Smart contracts for registering and managing names on the Ergo blockchain.
- **Off-chain Tools and Libraries**: Tools and libraries for interacting with the naming system off-chain.
- **Wallet and Application Integration**: Integration with Ergo wallets and applications for seamless user experience.

## Get Involved

Stay tuned for updates as ErgoNames progresses towards its mainnet launch, bringing a more accessible and user-friendly experience to the Ergo ecosystem.
