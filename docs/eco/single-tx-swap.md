# Single Transaction Swap

[Single Transaction Swap](https://www.single-tx-swap.com/) is a multisig trustless escrow service operating on the Ergo blockchain. It provides a secure platform for users to swap NFTs and tokens with others. If you've found a trading partner, for instance, on Discord, you can initiate a trading session on Single Transaction Swap and share a link to your private trading room with them.

The platform has recently incorporated features such as asset verification and transaction summary. Future enhancements are in the pipeline to improve user experience and functionality.
