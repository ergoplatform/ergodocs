# Cyberaid

[Cyberiad](https://www.zengate.global/products/cyberiad) is a geo-anchored national level metaverse infrastructure from [Zengate Global](zengate.md), designed to support a suite of government and private sector services.

Cyberiad enables these services to be accessible under a unified layer, with the ability to easily scale and embed new sector-agnostic products and services as consumer and user appetite grows.
