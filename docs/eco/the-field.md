# The Field

"The Field" is a peer-to-pool pledging protocol where individuals can pledge assets (coins or tokens) to support participants in competitions. The project is designed to be DAO-driven and open-source.

- The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Smart Contracts are complete, with no adjustments required this week. No further adjustments are needed for the guard bots.
- Integration of the dApp front-end UI for the MVP is ongoing - it is currently functional, but minor tweaks and improvements are expected soon.
- Private testing of pools and pledges is currently underway.
  - The guard group has successfully posted a test Market to receive pledges.
  - Pledging to the market has been successful (see below).
  - Once the Market closes and the guards post the results, testing of "pledge winnings and calculations" will occur.
- There is an ambitious goal to have an Olympic event next week for Live Beta testing from the community using small amounts (see below).
- Join the project's Discord server at https://discord.gg/wa38bX57tY to learn more and/or volunteer to help move the project and DAO forward.
