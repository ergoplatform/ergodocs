# Celaut  

[View on GitHub → Celaut Project](https://github.com/celaut-project)  

Celaut is a modular, distributed computing framework designed to run **decentralized services without relying on big tech platforms**. Instead of using AWS or Google Cloud to host services, Celaut enables anyone to deploy and manage autonomous services across independent devices and environments.  

It uses the **Ergo blockchain** to handle payments and reputation. Services can automatically charge for their work, and users can verify trustworthiness through on-chain reputation records. There’s no need to trust individual service providers—you trust the system itself.

## Why Is This Important?  

- Today’s internet relies on centralized companies that control infrastructure and take a cut of any value created.  
- Celaut removes this dependency by making it possible to run and pay for services directly between users, without middlemen.  
- Payments are automated with smart contracts, and reputation is tracked transparently on the blockchain.  
- This creates an open, permissionless digital economy where services are cheaper, more transparent, and community-controlled.

## About Celaut  

- **Reactive Service-Oriented Architecture**  
  Services in Celaut communicate through a messaging system that handles events and data transfer. The system balances workloads and optimizes where services run based on cost and available resources.

- **Nodo (Core Runtime)**  
  Nodo is the execution engine that manages deploying, running, and monitoring services. It also handles Ergo blockchain interactions for payments and reputation management.

- **Blockchain Payments and Reputation**  
  Using Ergo smart contracts, Celaut automates service payments and records reputation data. Trust is based on past behavior recorded on-chain, not on unverifiable claims.

- **Cost and Execution Optimization**  
  Celaut optimizes how and where services run by estimating costs and selecting the most efficient execution options across devices.

- **Docker Virtualization**  
  Services can be deployed in Docker containers, making them easy to distribute, manage, and scale.

## How Reputation Fits In  

Celaut integrates the concepts of a **Reputation System** directly into its service management. This ensures that services competing for attention and payments can build trust over time through verifiable, blockchain-based reputation scores.  

This system is critical for a decentralized environment where there’s no central authority to vet or validate services. Users know which services to trust by reviewing transparent, on-chain reputation data.  

Reputation influences everything from service availability to the cost of accessing certain services. It’s a core component for building marketplaces, peer-to-peer platforms, and automated digital economies without centralized control.

## Developer Integration  

Developers can build and deploy custom services directly into the Celaut ecosystem.

### Key Concepts  

- **Services**: Independent programs performing specific tasks, managed by the Celaut system.  
- **Gateways**: Communication interfaces between services and external APIs or data sources.  
- **Balancers**: Intelligent systems that optimize service placement and execution based on cost and efficiency.  
- **Payment System**: Automated smart contract payments on the Ergo blockchain.  
- **Reputation System**: Blockchain-backed trust records that help users evaluate the reliability of services.  

### Example Use Cases  

- Launch decentralized financial tools without relying on a company or third party.  
- Build services that perform large-scale data processing or machine learning tasks.  
- Create marketplaces where service providers compete based on reputation and efficiency.  
- Manage and deploy containerized workloads without needing cloud infrastructure providers.
