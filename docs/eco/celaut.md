# Celaut  

[View on GitHub → Celaut Project](https://github.com/celaut-project)  

Celaut is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network for deploying, managing, and monetizing **autonomous services** and **AI agents**. Inspired by the principles of **cellular automata**, Celaut separates **how a service solves a problem** from **where and who runs it**.  

This enables a new class of digital economy where services and AI agents compete for usage based on reputation and performance rather than centralized control or advertising.

---

## Background  

In the 1940s, John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam introduced **cellular automata**, systems where complex behaviors emerge from simple rules. Conway’s *Game of Life* later demonstrated how small, independent agents can create highly adaptive patterns through local interactions.  

Celaut applies these principles to software design, creating a decentralized digital ecosystem where simple, auditable services interact freely and evolve based on demand, trust, and performance.

## Why Is This Necessary?  

Modern services typically force you to choose between:

1. **Centralized Web Services**  
   - Easy to access  
   - No transparency or control over your data or the underlying code  
   - Providers can degrade service performance or misuse data  

2. **Running Open-Source Code Yourself**  
   - Full transparency and control  
   - Requires expensive infrastructure and technical expertise  
   - Not practical for everyday users  

Celaut offers a third path:  
- Infrastructure is provided by independent, decentralized nodes.  
- Services are deterministic, isolated, and tamper-proof after deployment.  
- Reputation and payments are managed transparently via Ergo smart contracts.  
- Users remain in control of how they interact with services and allocate value.

## Practical Example: Decentralized Trading Bots  

Today, using a trading bot requires either trusting a centralized platform or running complex software locally.  

With Celaut:  
- Trading bots are distributed services with verifiable on-chain reputations.  
- Users select bots based on transparent performance history recorded on Ergo.  
- Payments for bot usage happen automatically via Ergo smart contracts.  
- Developers cannot secretly alter or degrade their services after deployment.  

This creates a true open marketplace for financial automation tools where the best solutions succeed based on transparent reputation and real-world results.

## Celaut Architecture  

- **Nodes** ([Nodo Implementation](https://github.com/celaut-project/nodo))  
  - Manage execution, communication, and local gas metering.  
  - Provide Docker-like virtualized environments for isolated service execution.  
  - Operate independently in a decentralized network, supporting load balancing and peer-to-peer delegation.

- **Services**  
  - Deterministic, portable, and self-contained containers.  
  - Can request child services, enabling complex workflows.  
  - Fully abstracted from underlying infrastructure for maximum portability and security.

- **Economic Layer (On Ergo)**  
  - **Reputation System** ([Read More](eco/reputation-system.md)):  
    - Tracks node and service reliability through reputation proofs stored on-chain.  
    - Reputation influences service selection and pricing models.  
  - **Payment System**:  
    - Uses Ergo smart contracts for automatic licensing and value transfers.  
    - Supports pay-per-use and subscription models.

## Gas Metering and Economic Incentives  

- Nodes publish their Ergo wallet address, gas prices, supported architectures, and compute capabilities.  
- Clients acquire gas by performing on-chain transactions with deposit tokens linked to a node.  
- Nodes assign gas based on payment and deduct gas proportionally as services consume resources.  

**Load Balancing:**  
- Nodes choose whether to execute services locally or delegate to peer nodes based on gas costs and availability.  
- Clients remain unaware of internal delegations, maintaining seamless service access.

## Reputation System Overview  

Reputation is essential to establishing trust in a decentralized system without central authorities.

- **Proof Structure:**
    - R5: Type of entity (e.g., service, node, contract)
    - R6: Entity identifier (e.g., Box ID, Git repo, URL)
    - R7: Owner public key
    - R8: Opinion (positive or negative)

- **On-Chain Implementation:**
    - Reputation tokens function as trust proofs and can be audited on-chain.
    - Higher reputation leads to better market positioning and higher earnings.

- **Example:**
    - A service with a long, positive reputation history will be preferred over a newer, unproven one.
    - Nodes with better reputations offer more trusted execution environments.

## Real-World Use Cases  

- Peer-to-peer trading bots with verifiable historical performance  
- Decentralized AI agents for analytics, automation, and decision-making  
- Censorship-resistant infrastructure for critical APIs and web services  
- Autonomous investment platforms using reputation-driven agent selection  
- Decentralized marketplaces for AI models and computational services

## How It Works in Practice  

1. A user wants to execute an advanced trading strategy but lacks the infrastructure to run it.  
2. They choose a bot with a high on-chain reputation, verified through Ergo.  
3. The bot is executed on a Celaut node, and payment is made through a smart contract on Ergo.  
4. The node meters the execution with its gas system and deducts resources accordingly.  
5. If the node finds it more efficient to delegate the workload, it transparently does so by paying gas to a peer node.  
6. The user gets the result, and the service reputation is updated based on the outcome.

## Celaut is NOT a Blockchain  

- Celaut is not a consensus mechanism or Layer 1 protocol.  
- It is an off-chain execution and orchestration layer that complements blockchains like Ergo.  
- Ergo provides the financial and reputation layer; Celaut provides the scalable, decentralized execution layer.

### What Runs on Ergo and What Doesn’t?  

| Component               | On Ergo (On-Chain) | On Celaut (Off-Chain) |
|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Service Execution       | ❌                | ✅                   |
| Node Management         | ❌                | ✅                   |
| Gas Metering & Tracking | ✅ (via smart contracts) | ✅ (local node registries) |
| Payments & Licensing    | ✅ (Ergo smart contracts) | ❌                  |
| Reputation System       | ✅ (Reputation proofs stored on-chain) | ✅ (Used to inform decisions) |
| Service Metadata        | ✅ (Optional for auditability) | ✅ (Operational metadata) |
| Load Balancing & Delegation | ❌           | ✅                   |

Ergo handles financial accountability and reputation anchoring, while Celaut nodes handle the heavy computational work and service orchestration.
