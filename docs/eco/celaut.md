# Celaut  

Celaut is a modular, distributed computing framework designed to orchestrate and manage **autonomous services** in a secure and scalable environment. Using a **reactive, message-driven architecture**, it provides a platform for deploying, executing, and monitoring distributed services across heterogeneous computing environments.  

Celaut focuses on integration with the **Ergo blockchain**, using Ergo smart contracts for secure payment processing, service validation, and decentralized reputation management. Its architecture is general enough to support other blockchains, but current implementations primarily target Ergo.

## About Celaut  

- **Reactive Service-Oriented Architecture**  
  Celaut organizes services into modular components that communicate through a reactive messaging system. Workloads are dynamically balanced, and execution is optimized based on estimated costs and resource availability.

- **Nodo (Core Runtime and Management System)**  
  The Nodo repository provides the core execution environment. It manages service deployment, execution lifecycles, monitoring, and secure communication. Nodo also handles blockchain interactions, including payment processing and reputation validation through Ergo smart contracts.

- **Payment and Reputation Systems (Ergo Focused)**  
  Payments for service usage and trust scoring are handled directly through Ergo blockchain smart contracts. This ensures accountability and transparency without the need for centralized oversight. While the system could be extended to other blockchains, only Ergo is currently supported.

- **Built-in Cost and Execution Balancers**  
  Celaut provides dynamic balancing strategies to optimize service execution based on resource constraints and cost models. This helps reduce latency and maximize resource utilization across distributed systems.

- **Virtualization Support**  
  Docker-based service virtualization allows containerized services to be deployed and managed efficiently. Celaut automates the creation, configuration, and lifecycle management of these containers.

## Developer Integration  

Developers can extend Celaut by creating autonomous services and integrating them with the reactive messaging system. Custom APIs and external data sources can also be connected through built-in gateway components.

### Key Concepts  

- **Services**: Self-contained executables managed through Celautâ€™s messaging system.  
- **Gateways**: Communication modules for routing messages between services and external systems.  
- **Balancers**: Optimize service execution across nodes based on cost models and system load.  
- **Payment System**: Uses Ergo smart contracts to enforce payment conditions for service execution.  
- **Reputation System**: Validates trust and service history using on-chain reputation scores.  

### Example Use Cases  

- Deploy decentralized financial services validated through Ergo smart contracts.  
- Create automated services that process data or perform computations across distributed environments.  
- Build reputation-validated marketplaces for autonomous services.  
- Manage and optimize containerized workloads based on execution cost models.
