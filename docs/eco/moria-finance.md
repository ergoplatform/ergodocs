# Moria Finance: Decentralized Fund Management on Ergo

## Introduction

Moria Finance is a groundbreaking financial platform built on the Ergo blockchain, designed to revolutionize the way individual and corporate funds are managed. By leveraging the power of Ergo's advanced smart contracts, Moria Finance aims to provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized solution for fund management, offering a compelling alternative to traditional centralized custody solutions.

## The Vision

The primary goal of Moria Finance is to incentivize Bitcoin holders to bridge their assets to the Ergo blockchain in the form of rsBTC (Renominated Smart Bitcoin). By offering superior features and functionalities through Ergo's expressive smart contracts, Moria Finance aims to provide a compelling reason for BTC holders to embrace the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Ergo network.

## Key Features

### Smart Contract Wallets

At the core of Moria Finance's offering are advanced smart contract wallets that provide enhanced security, flexibility, and control over funds. These wallets leverage Ergo's powerful smart contract capabilities to implement various features, including:

1. **Timelock**: Funds can be locked for a predetermined period, preventing unauthorized access and providing an additional layer of security. This feature eliminates the need for self-custody, offering peace of mind to users.

2. **Reversible Address**: Moria Finance implements a reversible address design, where the user's public key is combined with a trusted third party's public key and the Moria Finance platform's public key. This design ensures that funds can only be accessed with the consent of all parties involved, providing an additional layer of security and trust.

3. **Multisig Management**: Moria Finance offers an easy-to-use multisig interface for managing corporate funds. The multisig server is implemented using Supabase Realtime, enabling companies to require signatures from multiple authorized parties before executing transactions, ensuring proper oversight and governance.

### Unparalleled Security

One of the key advantages of Moria Finance is the unparalleled security it offers through the combination of the Ergo blockchain and the Rosen Bridge. By bridging BTC to rsBTC on Ergo, users benefit from a two-layer security model:

1. **Decentralized Layer**: The Ergo blockchain provides a decentralized layer with n-of-1000 security, ensuring that no single entity can compromise the network.

2. **Federated Layer**: The Rosen Bridge adds a federated layer with n-of-100 security, further enhancing the overall security of the system.

Additionally, Ergo's smart contracts provide an extra layer of security, ensuring that funds are managed according to predefined rules and conditions.
