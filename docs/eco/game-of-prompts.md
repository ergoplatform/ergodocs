# Game of Prompts (GoP): AI Problems, Blockchain Solutions

**Project for [ErgoHack 10: AI on the Ergo Blockchain](ergohack.md)**

### 1. Introduction

Game of Prompts (GoP) is a pioneering competitive platform that merges Artificial Intelligence challenges with blockchain solutions. Developed on the Ergo and Celaut technologies, GoP facilitates a unique ecosystem where "game-services" (representing AI problems) are created by designers and subsequently evaluated by "solver-bots" implemented by players. The platform leverages the Ergo blockchain to ensure that the management of results and the transparent allocation of prizes are conducted in a verifiable and trustless manner.

### 2. Core Concept & Gameplay

GoP establishes a dynamic environment for competitive AI development and evaluation:

* **Game-Services by Designers:** Project designers create "game-services," which are essentially specific AI-driven problems or simulations.
* **Solver-Bots by Players:** Players develop "solver-bots" – intelligent agents – to interact with and solve these game-services.
* **Competitive Evaluation:** Solver-bots compete against each other, with their performance evaluated based on predefined metrics within the game-service.
* **Blockchain for Transparency:** All results, scores, and prize allocations are managed and recorded on the Ergo blockchain, ensuring full transparency, verifiability, and immutability.

### 3. AI Integration & Problem Types

The platform's methodology allows for the creation of diverse and complex AI challenges:

* **Simulated Financial Markets:** One prime example is a service-game that simulates dynamic financial markets (e.g., stocks, cryptocurrencies, commodities, forex). These simulations can incorporate historical data or generative models, including random or predefined market events (like black swan events). Solver-bots act as trading agents, making investment decisions (buying, selling, holding, using simple derivatives) to maximize portfolio returns.
* **Smart Contract System Emulation:** The methodology is particularly promising for emulating blockchain-specific interactions. For instance, a service-game could simulate the operation of Ergo's SigmaUSD contracts, with solver-bots competing to maximize profits by interacting with them. This not only validates bot strategies but also drives the creation of a rich and diverse ecosystem of bots for current and future dApps on Ergo and other blockchains.

### 4. Technical Details

Game of Prompts is built upon:

* **Blockchain Layer:** Ergo Platform (for verifiability, transparent result management, and prize allocation).
* **Core Technologies:** Celaut (facilitating the creation and evaluation of game-services and solver-bots).

### 5. Current Status & Progress (ErgoHack 10)

During ErgoHack 10, the Game of Prompts project has developed and submitted its core framework. The team has:

* Demonstrated the concept of trading bots competing within a simulated market environment.
* Uploaded a comprehensive document providing details about the project.
* Submitted a full video presentation explaining the platform and its underlying Celaut concepts.
* Made the project's GitHub repository publicly available, with the `README.md` serving as the main documentation.
