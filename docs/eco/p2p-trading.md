# P2P Trading

P2P trading, or peer-to-peer trading, is a method of exchanging cryptocurrencies directly between individuals without needing a centralised exchange or intermediary. In P2P trading, buyers and sellers connect directly with each other through a marketplace or platform, negotiate the terms of the trade, and then transfer the cryptocurrency directly between their wallets.

There are a couple of options for P2P trading on Ergo. 

- [Token Jay](https://tokenjay.app) lets you trade tokens person to person, trustless and decentralised with TokenJay's open P2P Escrow service.
- [single-tx-swap.com](https://www.single-tx-swap.com/) is a multi-sig trustless escrow service compatible with [Nautilus](wallets.md)
- [Analog Ergo](analog-ergo.md) is a cross-chain peer-to-peer marketplace in development.
