# Crystal Pool

Crystal Pool is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ergo blockchain, enabling real-time order-based trading directly on Layer 1. It is designed to provide a user experience comparable to centralized exchanges (CEXs) while maintaining the security and self-custody benefits of a DEX.

## Key Features

- **Limit Order DEX**: Crystal Pool is a limit order DEX, allowing users to place buy and sell orders with specific price limits.
- **Partial Fill**: Orders can be partially filled, enabling more efficient order matching and liquidity utilization.
- **Multiple Boxes in One Transaction**: Users can include multiple input boxes (UTXOs) in a single transaction, simplifying the trading process.
- **Multiple Sellers in One Transaction**: Multiple sellers can participate in a single transaction, facilitating more efficient order matching and execution.
- **Multi-Token Support**: Crystal Pool supports trading multiple tokens in a single transaction, enabling more diverse trading opportunities.

## How It Works

Crystal Pool leverages Ergo's advanced smart contract capabilities and the eUTXO model to create a decentralized order book and matching engine directly on the blockchain. Users can submit limit orders, which are stored on-chain as unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). The Crystal Pool smart contracts then match compatible buy and sell orders, executing trades and transferring assets between the respective parties.

By operating on Layer 1, Crystal Pool eliminates the need for centralized order books or off-chain matching engines, ensuring transparency, security, and censorship resistance. Additionally, the self-custodial nature of the platform allows users to maintain full control over their assets at all times.

## Benefits

- **Real-Time Trading**: Crystal Pool enables real-time order matching and execution, providing a seamless trading experience similar to centralized exchanges.
- **Security and Self-Custody**: Users retain full control over their assets, eliminating the need to trust a third-party custodian.
- **Transparency and Censorship Resistance**: All orders and trades are recorded on the immutable Ergo blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing censorship.
- **Composability**: As a Layer 1 solution, Crystal Pool can seamlessly integrate with other Ergo-based protocols and applications, enabling greater composability and innovation.

Crystal Pool represents a significant step forward in decentralized exchange technology, combining the benefits of self-custody and transparency with the user experience and liquidity of centralized platforms.
