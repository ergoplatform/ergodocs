## Game Mechanics

Blitz TCG is designed with competitive players in mind. It provides a consistent gaming experience where players can predict the outcome of their strategies based on the probability of drawing specific cards within a given number of turns. The game minimizes the role of luck and emphasizes skill and strategy by limiting the use of RNG (Random Number Generation).
