## *Covert* Addresses

You can configure a covert address in ErgoMixer; this is handy for displaying an address publicly to receive funds. You can set this address to automatically mix and withdraw your erg (or sigUSD if you prefer). 

## *Stealth* Addresses

A tool to hide recipient privacy. 

- [stealth address contract](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/stealth-address-contract/255)

Our latest ERGOHACK saw not one but two separate teams working on the stealth address concept introduced in [this forum post](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/stealth-address-contract/255)

`@aragogi` - [Stealth Scanner project + customized version of mixer in this repo](https://github.com/aragogi/Stealth-doc)

`@_jd_` - [adds addSignWithDhtData so user can sign a transaction w/ single dht tuple](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-playgrounds/pull/24)

## Tor support

Since ErgoMixer v3.0.0, there is Tor support available.
