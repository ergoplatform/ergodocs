# **DeCo (Decentralised Collaboration)**

DeCo, or 'Decentralised Collaboration', is an organic grassroots initiative that arose to fill the gap in developer resources and education for the Ergo ecosystem. It aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience for newcomers to immerse themselves in the technical aspects of Ergo through a structured curriculum and community engagement.

## Overview

DeCo operates courses in a semester format, similar to a university, to facilitate a structured learning experience. The courses cover various topics related to blockchain technology, the Ergo platform, and developing decentralized applications (dApps) on Ergo. DeCo is working on a comprehensive [workbook-format](https://deco-education.github.io/deco-docs/docs/intro) to serve as an educational resource.

## Courses and Resources

DeCo offers the following courses and resources:

- **Introduction, Layman, and ErgoScript Courses**: Available on the [DeCo Education YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyOIxD7YSHN5QwLIulOWrew/playlists).
- **The ErgoScript Developer Course**: A comprehensive course on developing with ErgoScript, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DeCo-Education/ErgoScript-Developer-Course).
- **Discord Server**: A hub for community engagement, support, and discussions, accessible via [this link](https://discord.gg/PQPyFbKZ9z).
- **Blog Post**: "DeCo and the Power of Community Initiatives on Ergo" provides insights into the initiative and its impact on the Ergo ecosystem ([link](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2022-04-21-deco-and-the-power-of-community-initiatives-on-ergo/)).
