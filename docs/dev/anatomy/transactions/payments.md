# Payments

ErgoPay and the web dApp connectors that Nautilus uses serve similar purposes but have key differences. ErgoPay can connect any wallet with any dApp, while a web dApp connector is limited to web extension wallets and website dApps. It can only connect processes living in the same web browser.

As a dApp developer, you may not know which type of wallet application will connect to your dApp. Therefore, a part of your logic must run on a server that can be accessed by user’s wallet applications. For a website dApp, this means that some of your code needs to live on your backend. This doesn’t necessarily complicate things. In fact, on the backend, you aren’t restricted to using JavaScript or its derivatives. You are free to choose the language and framework that best suits your needs.
