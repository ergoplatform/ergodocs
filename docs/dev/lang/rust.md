# Rust

On-chain contracts are developed in ErgoScript, a simple language designed for writing smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain. ErgoScript is a Turing-complete language that prioritizes security and is well-suited for the UTXO transactional model used by Ergo.

For off-chain components, such as interacting with the blockchain, creating transactions, and building applications, developers can use Rust along with frameworks like sigma-rust. Rust provides a powerful and efficient language for building off-chain components, while sigma-rust provides a Rust port of the sigmastate-interpreter, allowing developers to interact with the Ergo blockchain from their Rust applications.

One example of using Rust for off-chain components is the Oracle Pools project, a federated protocol for delivering external data to the Ergo blockchain. The on-chain contracts and descriptions are available in the Ergo Improvement Proposals (EIPs), while the off-chain part is implemented in Rust using the oracle-core repository.

Understanding the UTXO transactional model is crucial when developing off-chain components for Ergo, as it differs from the account-based model used by other blockchains. Developers with experience in parallel computing may find the UTXO model more natural to work with.
