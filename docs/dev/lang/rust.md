# Rust

On-chain contracts are developed in ErgoScript, a simple language designed for writing [smart contracts](ergoscript.md) on the Ergo blockchain. ErgoScript is a Turing-complete language that prioritizes [security](security.md) and is well-suited for the [UTXO transactional model](eutxo.md) used by Ergo.

For [off-chain components](off-chain-overview.md), such as interacting with the blockchain, creating [transactions](transactions.md), and building [applications](use-cases-overview.md), developers can use Rust along with frameworks like [sigma-rust](sigma-rust.md). Rust provides a powerful and efficient language for building off-chain components, while sigma-rust provides a Rust port of the [sigmastate-interpreter](sigmastate-interpreter.md), allowing developers to interact with the Ergo blockchain from their Rust applications. Various [language bindings for sigma-rust](sigma-rust.md#bindings) are available for other languages.

One example of using Rust for off-chain components is the [Oracle Pools project](oracles.md), a federated protocol for delivering external data to the Ergo blockchain. The on-chain contracts and descriptions are available in the [Ergo Improvement Proposals (EIPs)](eip.md), while the off-chain part is implemented in Rust using the [oracle-core](https://github.com/ergoplatform/oracle-core) repository.

Understanding the [UTXO transactional model](eutxo.md) is crucial when developing off-chain components for Ergo, as it differs from the [account-based model](accountveutxo.md) used by other blockchains. Developers with experience in parallel computing may find the UTXO model more natural to work with.
