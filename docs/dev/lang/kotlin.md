# Kotlin

Given that Kotlin is predominantly used as a JVM language, please refer to our [AppKit Guide](appkit.md) for additional resources.

We also offer [Mosaik](intro.md), which provides a [Kotlin DSL User Interface Tutorial](tutorial2.md) to help you understand and create user interfaces effectively.

For a practical demonstration of how to utilize AppKit in Kotlin, consider reviewing the [Ergo Wallet app](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet-app). This application, developed in Kotlin, provides a valuable case study on effective use of AppKit.
