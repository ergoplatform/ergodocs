# Kotlin

Given that [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is predominantly used as a [JVM](jvm.md) language, please refer to our [AppKit Guide](appkit.md) for additional resources.

We also offer [Mosaik](mosaik.md), which provides a [Kotlin DSL User Interface Tutorial](../stack/mosaik/tutorial2.md) to help you understand and create user interfaces effectively. (See the full [Mosaik Intro](../stack/mosaik/intro.md)).

For a practical demonstration of how to utilize [AppKit](appkit.md) in Kotlin, consider reviewing the [Ergo Wallet app](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet-app). This application, developed in Kotlin, provides a valuable case study on effective use of AppKit.
