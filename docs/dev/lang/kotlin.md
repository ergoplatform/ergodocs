# Kotlin

Given that Kotlin is predominantly used as a [JVM](jvm.md) language, please refer to our [AppKit Guide](appkit.md) for additional resources.

We also offer [Mosaik](mosaik.md), which provides a Kotlin DSL User Interface Tutorial to help you understand and create [user interfaces](get-started.md) effectively. (See the full [Mosaik Intro](intro.md)).

For a practical demonstration of how to utilize [AppKit](appkit.md) in Kotlin, consider reviewing the [Ergo Wallet app](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet-app). This application, developed in Kotlin, provides a valuable [case study](use-cases-overview.md) on effective use of AppKit.
