# Ergo Utilities in Rust

The [ergo-utilities-rust](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-utilities-rust) repository contains a collection of experimental libraries designed for writing off-chain Ergo code in Rust. These utilities provide a robust and efficient way to interact with the Ergo blockchain, enabling developers to build powerful and secure applications.

The utilities are built with a focus on performance, security, and ease of use. They offer a wide range of features, including transaction building, signing, and serialization, as well as various cryptographic functions.

For more information on working in Rust, see the [Sigma Rust documentation](sigma-rust.md).
