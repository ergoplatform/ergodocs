# Data Inputs in ErgoScript

ErgoScript's data inputs are a novel feature that enhances the traditional UTXO-based blockchain's functionality. This section delves into the concept of data inputs, their advantages, and their application within Ergo transactions.

## Understanding Data Inputs

Traditional UTXO-based blockchains involve the consumption and subsequent destruction of inputs during transactions. Ergo innovates on this model with **data inputs**, which permit transactions to reference and read from existing UTXOs without the need to consume them. This breakthrough overcomes several limitations of the classic UTXO model, adding a layer of flexibility and efficiency to Ergo's extended UTXO (eUTXO) model.

### Key Features of Data Inputs

- **Non-Destructive Access:** Data inputs grant transactions the ability to tap into UTXO contents without the need to spend or consume them, preserving the UTXOs for future transactions.
- **Concurrent Data Access:** Data inputs allow for the simultaneous referencing and reading of a UTXO's data by multiple transactions within a single block, without any of them spending the UTXO. This feature facilitates parallel processing and alleviates transaction execution bottlenecks.

## Benefits of Data Inputs

The integration of data inputs into ErgoScript offers several notable benefits:

1. **Reduced Transaction Fees:** Since data inputs do not necessitate script execution or the generation of new outputs, they contribute to lower transaction fees, making them an economical choice for intricate transactions.
  
2. **Enhanced DeFi Applications:** Data inputs prove invaluable for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or order-book systems. They enable contracts to reference external data, like oracle data or order book states, without the need to consume the data boxes, facilitating concurrent interactions with the same state by multiple parties.

3. **Improved Scalability and Efficiency:** Data inputs contribute to network scalability and efficiency by allowing several transactions to concurrently read from the same data input, reducing the necessity for extra outputs and lessening the likelihood of transaction conflicts.

## Working with Data Inputs

Ergo's data inputs are a distinctive feature not found in other eUTXO-based systems. When employing data inputs in ErgoScript, it's crucial to grasp their operation and how to leverage them effectively in smart contracts.

### Usage in Transactions

In ErgoScript, data inputs are "read-only" boxes that supply vital information for contract validation without being spent in the transaction. For instance, a DeFi contract might utilize a data input to verify an asset's current price from an oracle box, ensuring the transaction complies with specific conditions without modifying the oracle box.

### Example Use Case

Imagine a transaction that references a box with the ID `d2b9b6536287b242f436436ce5a1e4a117d7b4843a13ce3abe3168bff99924a1` as both an input and a data input. This illustrates the versatility of data inputs, enabling a transaction to read and potentially update a box's state in one operation, assuming the box pre-existed the transaction.

In ErgoScript, you can refer to other boxes in the transaction using constructs like:

```scala
INPUTS(0).value > 10000 && OUTPUTS(1).value > 20000
```

This script enforces conditions based on the values of the first input and the second output boxes, showcasing how data inputs can be used to influence the logic of a transaction without consuming the referenced boxes.

### Comparison with Traditional Models

Data inputs in ErgoScript provide a significant advancement over traditional UTXO models, particularly in how they facilitate more complex and interactive smart contracts.

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Selective Use:** Only include data inputs that are necessary for your contract logic to minimize transaction size and fees.
- **Reliable Sources:** Ensure that the data accessed through data inputs is reliable and comes from trusted sources, especially when using oracles or external data providers.
- **Validation Checks:** Always validate the data within data inputs to ensure it is in the expected format and state, reducing the risk of transaction failures.

### Conclusion

Data inputs are a powerful feature in ErgoScript that significantly enhance the flexibility, efficiency, and scalability of smart contracts. By allowing read-only access to UTXOs, data inputs enable more sophisticated interactions within the Ergo blockchain, making them an essential tool for developers building complex dApps and DeFi solutions.
