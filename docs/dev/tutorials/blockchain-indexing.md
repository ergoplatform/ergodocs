# Indexing Ergo Blockchain Data

Accessing and processing blockchain data efficiently is crucial for building responsive dApps, wallets, analytics tools, and other off-chain services on Ergo. Simply querying a live node for every piece of information can be slow and resource-intensive. Indexing involves processing blockchain data (blocks, transactions, boxes) and storing it in a readily queryable format (like a database) optimized for your application's specific needs.

This guide provides an overview and comparison of different strategies for indexing Ergo data.

## Why Index?

*   **Performance:** Querying a pre-built index (e.g., a database) is typically much faster than repeatedly querying the node's API, especially for complex lookups.
*   **Data Aggregation:** Indexers can aggregate data across multiple blocks or transactions (e.g., calculate total volume for a token, track historical balances).
*   **Custom Data Structures:** You can structure the indexed data precisely how your application needs it, simplifying application logic.
*   **Reduced Node Load:** Offloads complex queries from the Ergo node.

## Indexing Strategies Overview

There are three primary approaches to accessing indexed blockchain data:

1.  **[Using Public Explorer APIs](explorer-apis.md):** Leverage the APIs provided by public blockchain explorers. Easiest to start, but relies on third parties and has limitations.
2.  **[Querying Your Own Node's API Directly](node-api-direct.md):** Run your own node and query its REST API. Offers control but node APIs aren't optimized for complex queries.
3.  **[Building a Custom Indexer with SDKs](custom-indexer.md):** Develop a dedicated service to process blocks from your node and store relevant data in an optimized database. Most flexible and performant, but requires significant development effort.

## Choosing the Right Strategy

The best approach depends on your application's specific requirements:

**Notes:**
¹ Node API can be slow for historical lookups.
² Depends on the specific explorer's capabilities.
³ Explorer data might have slight delays.
⁴ Indexer needs time to process new blocks.
⁵ Requires running an Ergo node.
⁶ Requires running the indexer service and database.

For many non-trivial applications, building a **[Custom Indexer](custom-indexer.md)** provides the best balance of performance, flexibility, and control, despite the higher initial development effort. Explore the linked pages for more details on each strategy.
