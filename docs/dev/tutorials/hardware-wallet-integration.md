# Hardware Wallet Integration with sigma-rust

## Introduction

Integrating Ergo support into hardware wallets (like Ledger, Trezor, Keystone, etc.) presents unique challenges due to the resource-constrained nature of these devices (limited memory, processing power, and no standard library/OS). The standard [`sigma-rust`](sigma-rust.md) library, while comprehensive, relies on Rust's standard library (`std`) and certain dependencies that might be too heavy or unsuitable for embedded environments.

This guide provides developers with pointers and strategies for adapting `sigma-rust` functionality for hardware wallet integration, based on community discussions and efforts.

## Key Challenges

*   **No `std`:** Hardware wallets typically run bare-metal or on a minimal RTOS, lacking Rust's standard library (`std`). Code must be compatible with `no_std`.
*   **Limited Resources:** Memory (RAM and flash) and CPU cycles are scarce. Libraries and cryptographic operations must be efficient.
*   **Dependency Bloat:** Large dependencies can quickly exceed storage limits.
*   **Cryptographic Primitives:** Hardware wallets often have optimized, built-in implementations of core cryptographic primitives (like secp256k1) that should ideally be leveraged instead of pulling in separate library implementations.

## Adapting `sigma-rust`: Strategies and Tools

### 1. Using `sigma-rust-mini` and `no_std`

A community fork/effort, often referred to as `sigma-rust-mini`, aims to provide a `no_std`-compatible subset of `sigma-rust`.

*   **Repository (Example Fork):** [github.com/Alesfatalis/sigma-rust-mini/tree/no_std](https://github.com/Alesfatalis/sigma-rust-mini/tree/no_std) (Note: Check for the latest official or community-maintained versions).
*   **`no_std` Feature Flag:** When using such forks or potentially future versions of `sigma-rust`, look for a `no_std` feature flag in `Cargo.toml` to enable compatibility. This typically excludes parts of the library relying on `std`.

### 2. Replacing Cryptographic Backends (k256 vs. secp256k1)

`sigma-rust` often uses the [`k256`](https://crates.io/crates/k256) crate for secp256k1 operations. Hardware wallets usually have their own optimized `secp256k1` implementations (often using the [`secp256k1`](https://crates.io/crates/secp256k1) crate or a C library). To avoid duplicate code and leverage hardware optimizations, you'll likely need to:

*   **Fork `sigma-rust` (or `sigma-rust-mini`):** Modify the necessary parts of the library to use the hardware wallet's preferred `secp256k1` backend instead of `k256`.
*   **Focus Areas:** Pay close attention to areas involving key generation, signing, verification, and Diffie-Hellman operations.
*   **Key Types:** When working with the `secp256k1` crate, you'll typically use types like:
    *   `secp256k1::SecretKey`
    *   `secp256k1::PublicKey`
    *   `secp256k1::ecdsa::Signature`
*   **Relevant Methods (Hints from Dev Chat):** Community members have pointed towards needing methods like:
    *   `PublicKey::mul_tweak`: For operations related to key derivation or tweaking.
    *   `PublicKey::combine`: For combining public keys (e.g., in multi-sig or aggregated signatures).
    *   Consult the [`secp256k1` crate documentation](https://docs.rs/secp256k1/latest/secp256k1/) for details on using its API.

### 3. Minimizing Dependencies

Carefully review the dependency tree of the `sigma-rust` components you intend to use. Remove or replace dependencies that are too large or rely on `std`. This might involve:

*   Using feature flags to disable unused functionality.
*   Replacing crates with lighter-weight or `no_std` alternatives where possible.
*   Potentially re-implementing certain non-cryptographic helper functions if their dependencies are problematic.

## Core Functionality to Port

The essential functions needed for basic hardware wallet support typically include:

*   **Key Derivation:** Deriving child keys from a master seed according to [EIP-3](eip3.md).
*   **Address Generation:** Generating Ergo addresses from public keys.
*   **Transaction Parsing:** Securely parsing transaction details for display and user confirmation.
*   **Transaction Signing:** Signing the transaction digest using the derived private key. This is the most critical part and must use the hardware wallet's secure key storage and signing mechanism.
*   **ErgoTree Serialization/Hashing:** Potentially needed for constructing parts of the transaction message to be signed.

## Conclusion

Integrating Ergo with hardware wallets requires careful adaptation of existing libraries like `sigma-rust`. Leveraging `no_std` compatible forks/versions, replacing cryptographic backends to use the device's optimized implementations (like `secp256k1`), and minimizing dependencies are key strategies. This is a complex task often requiring deep knowledge of both the Ergo protocol and embedded Rust development. Collaboration within the developer community is crucial for advancing hardware wallet support.
