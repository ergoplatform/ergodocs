[SafeW](https://github.com/ThierryM1212/SAFEW) is a Simple And Fast Ergo Wallet that integrates a dApp connector compatible with EIP-12. It is compatible with Chrome-based browsers (Opera, Brave, Edge, Kiwi, etc.) and Firefox. SAFEW was recognized in [ErgoHack](ergohack.md) 3.

It is ideal for developers because it provides access to the ErgoMixer, a transaction builder in Expert mode, and additional advanced features.

## Security

Wallets are stored in the local storage of the SAFEW browser extension. The mnemonic is encrypted with AES-256 using the spending password, which is not stored in the application. The password is required for spending funds or managing addresses. ErgoPay wallets allow for remote transaction signing using iOS or Android wallet v1.6+, avoiding the need to store the encrypted mnemonic in the browser extension's local storage.

## Privacy

Address discovery can be initiated at any time to generate unused addresses. Non-connected sites cannot access wallet information, while connected sites can read the wallet content. The explorer and node used for interacting with the Ergo blockchain are configurable. ErgoPay/ReadOnly wallets enhance privacy by keeping wallet contents hidden. ErgoMixer integration facilitates the use of privacy tools.

## Reliability

The transaction balance displayed when sending funds with SAFEW is computed from the unsigned transaction, not from the UI inputs.
