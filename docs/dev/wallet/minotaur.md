## Building the Wallet from Source

Ensure Node.js version 20.11 is installed before attempting to build Minotaur:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:minotaur-ergo/minotaur-wallet.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory and install dependencies:

   ```
   cd minotaur-wallet
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project with the following commands:

   ```
   npm run build
   npx cap sync
   npx cap update
   ```

   The last two commands synchronize the codebase for Android and iOS platforms. For desktop builds, synchronize the Electron code with:

   ```
   npx cap sync electron
   npx cap update electron
   ```

## Platform-Specific Builds

### Android

Open the `android` directory within the project using Android Studio and proceed with the build process using the IDE or alternative build tools.

### iOS

iOS developers can open the project in Xcode and build the desired version directly from the IDE.

### Desktop

For desktop builds, enter the Electron directory and execute the following commands:

   ```
   npm run build
   npm run electron:pack
   npm run electron:make
   ```

### MacOS

Apple Silicon (M-series) users should opt for the `arm64` build to avoid camera issues. If encountering a "_damaged file_" error, execute:

   ```
   sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/minotaur.app
   ```

## Testnet Trials

Minotaur is compatible with both Mainnet and Testnet. To test the wallet, generate a new wallet and acquire test Ergos from [Ergo's Testnet Faucet](https://testnet.ergofaucet.org/).
