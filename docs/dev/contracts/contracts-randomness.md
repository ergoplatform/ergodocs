# Randomness — Contract Patterns

## Overview

Randomness patterns provide unbiased or economically-secure randomness for on-chain decisions, often via commit–reveal, VRF, or protocol-derived entropy.

## Patterns

- [Randomness from ErgoRaffle](pattern-randomness-from-raffle.md)

## Planned additions

- Commit–Reveal Schemes (multi-party)
- VRF-Based Draws (if/when available)
- Beacon from Block Data (with bias/liveness analysis)
