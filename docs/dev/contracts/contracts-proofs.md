# Proofs — Contract Patterns

## Overview

Proof patterns verify cryptographic statements on-chain. They typically leverage Sigma protocols (e.g., Schnorr) and range proofs, enabling advanced constraints without revealing secrets.

## Patterns

- [Bulletproof Range Proof Verification](pattern-bulletproof-range-proof.md)
- [Schnorr Signature Verification](pattern-schnorr-verification.md)

## Planned additions

- Multistatement Proof Composition (AND/OR thresholds)
- Ring & Threshold Sigma Protocol Variants
- Commit–Reveal with Proof Binding
