# Perpetual Tokens

ErgoScript allows the creation of a '*perpetual token*', a token that is designed to exist indefinitely, unless it is removed by garbage collection.

```scala
    {
      val isPerpetual = {(b: Box) =>
        b.propositionBytes == SELF.propositionBytes && b.tokens == SELF.tokens
      }

      sigmaProp(OUTPUTS.exists(isPerpetual))
    }
```

This code snippet ensures the persistence of a collection of perpetual tokens, even if the collection's size is zero. If you protect a single token using this script, it guarantees that the token will only be removed by garbage collection.

## Multi-Stage Protocols

Multi-stage protocols are beneficial in situations where multiple scripts need to interact. In these protocols, a script can reference the script of a subsequent stage.

For instance, consider the following example:

In `script1`, we have the statement:

```scala
hash(OUTPUTS(0).propositionBytes) == script2Hash
```

Here, `script1` verifies if the hash of the first output's `propositionBytes` matches the hash of `script2`.

But, if we want `script2` to refer back to `script1`, as shown below:

```scala
hash(OUTPUTS(0).propositionBytes) == script1Hash
```

We face a cyclic reference problem, as both scripts are referencing each other.

To overcome this, we can store `script1Hash` in a register of the [box](box.md) that contains `script2`. We also need to modify `script1` to ensure that the corresponding register of any box containing `script2` equals `hash(SELF.propositionBytes)`.

While the "vanilla" perpetual token is intriguing, the "max-once-per-block-use" perpetual token offers more flexibility and power, and should be considered as a distinct design pattern.
