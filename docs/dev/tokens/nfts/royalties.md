# Royalties

Royalties on Ergo are part of the minting `metadata` and are accessible through smart contracts. This means marketplaces have the option have including this in their sale contracts (which both sky harbor and auction house do). Any listing on a marketplace which respects royalties cannot have the royalties bypassed since it is part of their smart contract. 

That said, NFTs can clearly just be sent p2p to each other (just like when you transfer across wallets) and in these situations or in private sales its up to the discretion of the involved parties whether to honour the royalties. 

AuctionHouse V3 will support multiple recipients for royalties which enables artists to collaborate together.
