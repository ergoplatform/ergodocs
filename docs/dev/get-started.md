## Ergo Platform Overview

Ergo is a next-generation **Proof-of-Work (PoW)** blockchain platform designed for secure, efficient, and decentralized smart contract execution. It lays the foundation for a new wave of blockchain-based applications, focusing on scalability, security, and privacy. Ergo leverages advanced technologies like the powerful scripting language **ErgoScript**, flexible **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**, and the **eUTXO model**, an evolution of Bitcoin's UTXO model.

- Get a concise overview of Ergo, its standout features, and the technology and decisions that power it on the **[*Why Ergo?*](why.md)** page.
- Find answers to the most common questions about Ergo in our **[FAQ](faq.md)**.

### Key Features

- **ErgoScript**: A simple high-level language that enables clear descriptions of contractual logic. ErgoScript supports the creation of flexible crypto-contracts based on Î£-protocols (a class of Zero-Knowledge Proofs), allowing for privacy-preserving transactions and complex smart contract functionality.

- **Extended UTXO Model (eUTXO)**: The [eUTXO](eutxo.md) model allows each UTXO to carry arbitrary data and be protected by an arbitrary predicate or spending condition. This flexibility enables the representation of various assets, tokens, and smart contract states within the blockchain.

- **Mining with Autolykos**: Ergo utilizes [Autolykos](autolykos.md), an efficient, ASIC-resistant Proof-of-Work algorithm designed for a fair launch.
    - Learn about Ergo's [Emission](emission.md) schedule.

- **[NiPoPoWs](nipopows.md)**: Short for Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work, these are compact data structures that validate blockchain events without needing full network connectivity or downloading all block headers. They enable efficient light clients, log-space mining, and trustless sidechains.

- **Storage Rent**: Also known as [demurrage](rent.md), this mechanism mitigates blockchain bloat and turns it into a profitable venture by charging for on-chain storage.

- **Turing-Complete Smart Contracts**: Ergo supports [Turing-complete smart contracts](#multi-stage-protocols), enabling complex on-chain computations.

### Transactional Model

Ergo adopts a transactional approach similar to Bitcoin's UTXO model. In this model, transactions utilize and produce single-use entities known as ['boxes'](box.md). Every [transaction](transactions.md) in Ergo represents an atomic state transition, consuming boxes from the state and creating new ones in their place. The eUTXO model allows each UTXO to carry arbitrary data and be protected by an arbitrary predicate (or [spending condition](types.md#sigmaprop)). The data can represent various tokens or smart contract states.

[![Ergo Model](../assets/ergo-model.png)](../assets/ergo-model.png)

*This image illustrates the structure and process flow of a blockchain transaction on the Ergo platform using its **extended UTXO model** (eUTXO).*

## ErgoScript

ErgoScript is a super-simple subset of Scala, enabling clear descriptions of contractual logic that can be Turing-complete. It is flexible enough to allow for ring signatures, multi-signatures, multiple currencies, atomic swaps, self-replicating scripts, and long-term computation.

The Account model of Ethereum is imperative, meaning that sending coins from Alice to Bob requires changing balances in storage through a series of operations. In contrast, Ergo's UTXO-based programming model is declarative. ErgoScript contracts specify conditions for a transaction to be accepted by the blockchain, not changes to be made in the storage state as a result of the contract execution.

### Interpreters

ErgoScript has two compiler and ErgoTree interpreter implementations for the [*Sigma Language*](sigma-lang.md):

- **[Sigmastate-interpreter](sigmastate-interpreter.md)**: For JVM languages, utilized by [AppKit](appkit.md).

- **[Sigma-Rust](sigma-rust.md)**: A simpler alternative for the ErgoTree interpreter and transaction tools.

## Cryptography

Ergo has generic support for ring and threshold signatures, as well as a variety of cryptographic protocols via composable [sigma-protocols](crypto.md) built into the core.

Sigma Protocols (Î£-Protocols) are the foundation of Ergoâ€™s smart contracts. Their advantage is that they are composable using simple AND/OR logic. When combined with a blockchain, these composable proofs enable very powerful use cases, allowing for the implementation of sophisticated tasks that would otherwise be impossible, risky, or expensive on other platforms.

### Crypto Primitives

- **Hash Functions**:
    - `Sha256`: Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit.
    - `Blake2b256`: A cryptographic hash function faster than MD5 and SHA-256, providing security similar to the strongest hash functions available.

- **Encoding**:
    - `Base58`: A binary-to-text encoding scheme used for encoding Bitcoin addresses and other text-based data.

- **Signing Algorithms**:
    - `ECDSA (secp256k1)`: Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm over the secp256k1 curve, widely used in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
    - `Schnorr`: A digital signature scheme that is simple, provably secure in the random oracle model, and allows for the aggregation of multiple signatures into a single signature, enhancing efficiency and privacy.

- **Primitive Secrets**:
    - **[Schnorr Signature](schnorr.md)**: A proof of knowledge of a discrete logarithm with respect to a fixed group generator.
    - **[Diffie-Hellman Tuple](diffie.md)**: A proof of equality of discrete logarithms, enabling secure exchange of cryptographic keys over a public channel.

- **Non-Interactive Proofs**:
    - The proofs of sigma-statements are made non-interactive with the [**Fiat-Shamir transformation**](diffie.md#fiat-shamir-transformation), which converts an interactive proof of knowledge into a non-interactive one by using a cryptographic hash function.

- **Additional Cryptographic Standards**:
    - **[EIP-0003: Deterministic Wallet Standard](eip3.md)**: A standard defining the structure and operation of deterministic wallets in the Ergo platform.

See [this page](scs/global-functions.md#cryptographic-functions) for a description of the global cryptographic functions available in ErgoScript. *(Corrected path and anchor)*

### Tools

- **[Scrypto](scrypto.md)**: A comprehensive open-source cryptographic toolkit, specifically engineered to simplify and safeguard the process of integrating cryptography into your applications. Supports AVL+ Trees and Batch Merkle Proof Serialization and Deserialization.

## Advanced Concepts

### Merkle Trees

**[Merkle Trees](merkle-tree.md)** are a fundamental data structure in the Ergo blockchain, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of data. They play a crucial role in various blockchain operations, from verifying transactions within blocks to securing additional metadata in the Extension Block. Ergo extends the concept of Merkle Trees by combining transactions and their corresponding spending proofs into a single Merkle Tree.

Developers should familiarize themselves with Merkle Trees and their associated code implementations to effectively leverage them in their Ergo projects.

### AVL Trees (Plasma)

**[AVL trees](avl.md)** are highly efficient authenticated data structures natively supported in Ergo. These trees offer several benefits, including the ability to authenticate data properties without accessing the entire dataset. Developers can seamlessly integrate AVL trees into their Ergo applications using one of the **[Plasma](plasma.md)** libraries.

### Multi-Stage Protocols

[Multi-Stage Contracts](multi.md) is a technique where, using transaction trees, we can emulate persistent storage in UTXO-based systems by linking several UTXOs containing small pieces of code to form a large multi-stage protocol. This enables *on-chain computations*, making it possible to process parallelized actions on top of smart contracts and construct **Turing-complete** applications.

## App Development

Developers have a plethora of tools, libraries, SDKs, frameworks, and utilities at their disposal to seamlessly interact with the blockchain, craft applications, and present them to users. Navigate through the [Developer Section](start.md) to use grid buttons that help refine your technical stack requirements and pinpoint the ideal tooling.
