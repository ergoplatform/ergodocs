# Mutual Credit System on Ergo

A mutual credit system is a type of alternative currency system in which the currency used is not a commodity but an accounting unit. In this system, credit is given by all participants, through a system of IOUs that are issued and managed collectively by the community. This system allows for a flexible, decentralized form of trade, where value is not tied to a physical commodity but to the trust and cooperation of the community.

Ergo's technology can be utilized to implement a global mutual credit system. This system would be trustless and collateralized, meaning that it does not rely on the trustworthiness of individual participants and is backed by collateral to prevent default.

One way to implement this on Ergo is by combining it with ErgoFund. ErgoFund is a decentralized crowdfunding platform on the Ergo blockchain. Funds collected through ErgoFund can be used to open a credit line in the mutual credit system. This allows participants to spend money for services within the mutual credit system, creating a self-sustaining economy.
