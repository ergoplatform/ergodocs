## Overview

**What is Arbit?**

Arbit streamlines the process of arbitrage trading by providing a clean and simple interface. The platform identifies opportunities where a user can buy and sell tokens across different decentralized exchanges to make a profit.

- **Supported Tokens:** ERG, ADA, and RSN.
- **Supported Exchanges:** Ergo Dex and Splash.
- **Core Features:**

  - Predefined arbitrage strategies (called "Arbits").
  - Focus on simplicity and usability.
  - Execution of swaps with just a few clicks.

**What is an Arbit?**

An Arbit is a series of swaps that generate profit. For example:

1. Sell 100 X tokens on Exchange A for $100.
2. Buy 105 Y tokens on Exchange B for the same $100.
3. Profit from the additional 5 Y tokens.

---

## Key Features

### Simplicity and Usability

- Designed for users with basic blockchain knowledge.
- Clear interface with no distractions or unnecessary complexity.
- Profitability of swaps displayed prominently.

### Fixed Arbitrage Strategies

- Supports predefined arbitrage paths, such as:

  - ERG ↔ ADA
  - RSN ↔ ADA

- Profit calculations are based on fixed USD values ($50 and $100).

---

## How It Works

1. **Arbitrage Strategy Execution:**

    - Predefined paths calculate profitability based on current market conditions.
    - Fixed token values ($50 and $100) are used for calculations to avoid complexity.

2. **Supported Providers:**

    - **Ergo Dex:** Facilitates ERG and ADA swaps.
    - **Splash:** Enables swapping of RSN and ADA tokens.

3. **Profit Calculation:**

    - Example for a $50 swap:
        - Sell $50 worth of rsADA on Ergo Dex for ERG.
        - Swap ERG for ADA on Splash.
        - Compare the ADA received with the initial $50 equivalent.

## Deployment

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ConnecMent/arbit.git
    cd arbit
    ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

    - `SPLASH_API_URL`: API URL for Splash exchange.
    - `ERGO_EXPLORER_API_URL`: API URL for Ergo Explorer.

    Example:

    ```env
    SPLASH_API_URL=https://api.splash.exchange
    ERGO_EXPLORER_API_URL=https://api.ergoplatform.com
    ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**

    Install dependencies and start the development server:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Arbitrage Strategies

The following strategies are implemented in Arbit:

### ERG ↔ ADA Arbitrage

- Leverages Ergo Dex and Splash to identify profitable swaps between ERG and ADA.
- Calculations consider both direct and reverse swap paths for maximum opportunities.

### RSN ↔ ADA Arbitrage

- Utilizes Ergo Dex and Splash for swaps between RSN and ADA tokens.
- Similar profit calculation methods as the ERG ↔ ADA strategy.

---

## Technical Details

### Core Arbitrage Logic

The core logic for arbitrage is implemented in `src/arbitrategy.ts`. It defines a set of predefined strategies for swapping between supported tokens and providers.

### Provider Integrations

- **Ergo Dex (`src/providers/ergodex.ts`):**

  - Interacts with the Ergo Dex SDK for swapping tokens.
  - Supports `x2y` and `y2x` operations.

- **Splash (`src/providers/splash.ts`):**

  - Uses the Splash API to fetch order book data.
  - Supports bid/ask matching for liquidity and price calculations.

---

## Usage Guide

1. **Prepare Tokens:**

    - Ensure you have supported tokens (ERG, ADA, RSN) on Ergo and Cardano chains.
    - Use [Rosen Bridge](https://app.rosen.tech) to bridge assets if necessary.

2. **Visit the App:**

    - Open the application and review the displayed arbitrage opportunities.

3. **Execute a Swap:**

    - If a profitable Arbit is available, execute the swap by following the on-screen instructions.
