# Trustless Prediction Markets

Due to Ergo's use of the UTXO-model + data inputs we can have 100% trustless prediction markets about the state of any dApp on the entire blockchain.

You can make permissionless and trustless prediction markets about literally any data on the blockchain, and to prove who wins in the prediction all one has to do is make a tx with a specific utxo as a data-input, and you have trustless verificaition and payout.

This is likely also expandable into trustless on-chain insurance as well.
