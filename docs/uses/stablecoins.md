# Stablecoins

Blockchain assets can be extremely volatile. That’s why investors often seek digital assets which are pegged to national currencies. A Stablecoin is the most primitive integration of cryptocurrencies with the off-chain world. Until DAI, fiat custody services were provided by centralized services. The first example of a stable coin, USDT, is backed by [actual dollars](https://cryptobriefing.com/external-auditor-first-confirm-tethers-usdt-backing/) held in banks. However, for a decentralized financial system, we need other means of fiat-pegged currencies. 


## SigmaUSD
> [sigmausd.io](https://sigmausd.io), The worlds first UTxO-based stable coin - an instantiation of the [AgeUSD protocol](https://github.com/Emurgo/age-usd). Its economic model designed in partnership between IOHK, Ergo, and Emurgo maintains the conservative settings for collateral reserves and avoids the need for liquidations. Along with that, it supports a fully decentralised stablecoin emission setup.

The UI for the front-end is available at [anon-real/sigma-usd](https://github.com/anon-real/sigma-usd). For more information and a more general overview please see [ergonaut.space](https://ergonaut.space)
