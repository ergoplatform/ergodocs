# Index Coins

Not all crypto investors are conscient of different blockchain use cases. Some of the investors may want to benefit from indexed tokens to invest in various cryptocurrencies. For such an innovation, dynamic market-making(DMM) algorithms would be necessary to adjust the funds after price changes. Besides, people who will release index tokens must have the market knowledge to decide which tokens must be involved in the indexed and for how many percentage. Some examples of index coins running on Ethereum are ASSY, YETI, PIPT, YLA issued by [Powerpool Protocol](https://powerpool.finance/).
