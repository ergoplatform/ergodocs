# Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding for common infrastructure and tooling on the Ergo network is a way for users, developers, and miners to work together to fund and advance the network far into the future.

1. We already have crowdfunding on the Ergo blockchain via [Ergo Raffle](ergoraffle.md); this allows projects to host *'Raffles'* with a prize percentage allocated to the lucky donor.
2. [ErgoWell](ergowell.md) is a project meant to be used for investing in ventures trying to raise money through crowdfunding.
3. [ErgoFund](ergofund.md) will eventually provide a more sophisticated crowdfunding experience, with contracts for campaigns with thousands of pledges and enable 'Self-Soverign DeFi'
