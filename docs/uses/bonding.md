# Bonding Curves

Bonding curves are a useful primitive for continuous token offerings (CTOs), [augmented bonded curves](https://medium.com/giveth/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-3f1f7c1fa751), and perhaps AMM DEXes.

There is a cheap way to do bonding curves on Ergo, with most of the load performed off-chain.

Assume a project is willing to issue 100 tokens and sell the first one for `100` ergs, second for `200`, ..., 100th for `10,000` ergs (to raise 505,000) in total in case of full sale. This is a very simple example of a bonding curve. See [this article](https://blog.relevant.community/bonding-curves-in-depth-intuition-parametrization-d3905a681e0a) for more details.

Sell-only
-------------

First, assume a token sale scenario only. The token issuer creates 100 boxes with one token each, with a set price for the token in register R4 of a box. The box is spendable if the spending transaction pays the price to the issuer's address (issuer's script in general).

Sell with buy-back
--------------------------

Now assume that token sell comes with a buy-back guarantee, e.g. seller is buying back tokens within one year since selling for 95% of the selling price. The selling contract requires a spending transaction to lock 95% of the price, at least with buying contract. Buying contract is time-locked and requires a spending transaction to send token bought-back to a predefined address (e.g. issuer's).

Clients
----------

As the curve is made upon many boxes, some work is required on the client-side, namely the possibility of finding boxes associated with the token and selling-script, and then sorting the boxes by R4.
