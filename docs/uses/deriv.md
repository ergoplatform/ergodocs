# Derivatives and Decentralized Options Trading on Ergo

Ergo's powerful capabilities enable the creation of innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) primitives, including derivatives and options trading protocols. These protocols offer traders alternative platforms for speculating on asset prices, managing risk, and generating yield in a trustless and decentralized manner.

## Decentralized Options Trading

### Hodlcoin

Hodlcoin is a high-risk, high-reward game that encourages players to "HODL" their ERGs. Players can deposit their ERGs into a common reserve (HODLing) or withdraw ERGs from the reserve by burning their HODL ERGs (un-HODLing). Un-HODLing incurs a penalty fee (e.g., 3% or 10%) that is added to the common reserve, creating an incentive for players to hold their ERGs for longer periods.

### OptionCoin

OptionCoin is a novel concept that combines decentralized options trading with token emission on the Ergo blockchain. It is a smart contract that periodically issues new tokens and sells them via call options, with the exercise price determined by the current market price on a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Spectrum. Traders can buy or sell these call options, allowing them to speculate on the future price of OptionCoin.

### OptionPools

OptionPools is a groundbreaking pool-to-peer Automated Market Maker (AMM) trading protocol designed for decentralized options trading. Built on the robust Ergo blockchain, OptionPools leverages Ergo's unique capabilities to create a secure and efficient platform for trading options directly on Layer 1. It introduces innovative features like dual-asset liquidity pools, on-chain Black-Scholes pricing, and options price adjustments based on real-time pool utility.

## Other Derivatives

In addition to options trading, Ergo's Multi-Stage Contracts enable the development of various other derivative protocols, such as:
