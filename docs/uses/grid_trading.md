Off the Grid is a decentralized application (dApp) that builds on the grid trading contract proposed by kushti. It includes an execution bot/batcher for automating order matching without user interaction.

Machina Finance is another project on Ergo that is exploring the concept of grid trading. It is developing a decentralized exchange (DEX) that utilizes grid order contracts.
