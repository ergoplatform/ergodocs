# Decentralised Grid Trading

This is a concept introduced by `@kushti` on [ergoforum](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/decentralized-grid-trading-on-ergo/)

> We can do decentralized grid trading on Ergo (which is automatically compatible with existing DEXes, such as Spectrum LP pools and babel fees). Grid trading is a good way to make profits from volatility , and many CEXes offer it.
