# Securing the Network

Ergo is secured by Proof-of-Work. If you want to help secure the network or mine ERG, start with the Mining section. This page gives you an overview and direct links.

## Choose Your Path

- Try CPU mining on Testnet: [CPU Mining (Testnet)](cpu-mining.md)
- Pool mining (recommended): [Join a Pool](join.md)
- Solo mining: [Solo Overview](solo.md) â€¢ [Solo Node Configuration](solo-node.md)

## FAQ

- How much VRAM do I need to mine?  
  Most modern Autolykos miners require at least 6 GB VRAM per GPU. See [mining software](software.md) and vendor notes.

- Can I mine with my CPU?  
  Yes on Testnet for experimentation: [CPU Mining](cpu-mining.md). Mainnet GPU mining is recommended.

- Should I mine solo or join a pool?  
  Pools provide more consistent payouts. Solo mining is viable only with significant hashrate.
