# Partnerships and Development Requests

This page explains how individuals, teams, organizations, and investors can connect with the Ergo ecosystem. The Ergo community is built on open-source principles, community-led development, and decentralized governance.

Ergo is an open source Proof of Work smart contract platform, built from scratch with our own implementation of the extended UTXO model. It was designed for ordinary people first, as broad grassroots adoption is the foundation of our decentralization.

While community members remain at the heart of the project, the Ergo Foundation believes this is the right time to raise awareness among institutional investors, VC funds, private wealth funds, major crypto companies, and other influential partners.

## Partnerships

Partnerships can include:

- Technical collaborations
- Developer resource sharing
- dApp or infrastructure integrations
- Co-marketing campaigns
- Strategic alliances with ecosystem projects

**How we can help:**  
The Ergo Foundation can assist with due diligence, connect you with relevant contributors, and guide you toward funding or collaboration channels.  

**Funding and collaboration channels:**

- [Ergo Raffle](https://ergoraffle.com) – Community-driven funding  
- [Development DAO](https://app.paideia.im/devdao) – Primary DAO managing development funding and priorities  
- [Sigmanauts DAO](https://app.paideia.im/sigmanauts) – Grassroots initiatives

## Exchange Listings

We welcome discussions with centralized and decentralized exchanges interested in listing $ERG.  

The Ergo Foundation can:

- Provide technical integration support
- Supply branding and marketing assets
- Facilitate connections with the community for liquidity support

**Important:**  
Listing fees are usually funded by the community, often coordinated via [Ergo Raffle](https://ergoraffle.com). The Ergo Foundation Treasury is small and operated as a DAO, so any significant funding needs require community coordination.

## OTC / Investment Requests

Ergo launched with no pre-mine. The Ergo Foundation Treasury operates as a DAO with a small allocation, which means there is no capacity for large over-the-counter (OTC) arrangements.  

However, we welcome investors who want to contribute beyond capital, such as:

- Developer resources  
- Infrastructure and ecosystem support  
- Awareness campaigns through association with leading brands and networks  
- Professional expertise to introduce advanced business models and dApps  

These contributions strengthen the ecosystem and help accelerate adoption.
