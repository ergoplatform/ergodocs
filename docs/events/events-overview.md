# Ergo Events

Ergo hosts a variety of events to engage with the community, share updates, and foster innovation. These events provide an excellent opportunity to learn more about Ergo, interact with the team, and contribute to the ecosystem.

## ErgoHack and ErgoSummit

Our flagship events, [ErgoHack](ergohack.md) and [ErgoSummit](ergosummit.md), are held regularly. These events bring together developers, enthusiasts and thought leaders from the Ergo community. Visit the respective pages to learn more about past events and stay updated on upcoming ones.

We host weekly [Ask Me Anything (AMAs)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/search?q=flair%3AAMA&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) sessions and regular [developer updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AWEEKLY-DEV) on Reddit. These sessions provide insights into Ergo's development progress and offer a platform for the community to ask questions directly to the team.
