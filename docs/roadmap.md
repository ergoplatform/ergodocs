# Ergo Development Roadmap & History

Ergo is a blockchain platform designed to provide a secure, efficient, and user-friendly environment for the development of decentralized applications and financial tools. This roadmap outlines the key milestones and objectives for the development and growth of the Ergo ecosystem.

## Resources

//// details | Vision & Key Features
    {type: info, open: false}

Ergo is a cutting-edge smart contract platform that provides secure, accessible, and decentralized financial tools to empower ordinary people. Utilizing a sophisticated scripting language and advanced cryptographic features, Ergo builds on fundamental blockchain principles to transform the concept of Contractual Money.

Ergo aims to establish itself as a mineable digital asset akin to "Digital Gold 2.0," supporting trustless derivatives and dynamic contracts. The development of Ergo’s DeFi ecosystem and the integration of sidechains will broaden the decentralized monetary base and derivative money supply, enhancing financial inclusivity and accessibility worldwide.

Ergo’s commitment to decentralization, fairness, and accessibility is evident in its adoption of the Autolykos Proof-of-Work protocol, which facilitates a user-friendly environment where lightweight clients can interact directly with the blockchain, making Ergo a practical and programmable currency ready for use.


- [x] **eUTXO Model:** Allows UTXOs to carry arbitrary data and complex scripts, enabling advanced smart contracts
- [x] **Autolykos PoW Algorithm:** ASIC-resistant and designed for fair mining, promoting decentralization
- [x] **Emission Schedule:** Ensures a stable and predictable supply of ERG tokens
- [x] **NiPoPoWs (Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work):** Enables efficient light clients, log-space mining, trustless sidechains, and enhances accessibility and decentralization by allowing mobile SPV clients and lite full nodes
- [x] **ErgoScript:** Supports clear and concise smart contract development with Σ-protocols
- [x] **Storage Rent:** Mitigates blockchain bloat, incentivizes efficient storage usage, and contributes to long-term economic sustainability
- [x] **Turing-Complete Smart Contracts:** Allows for complex on-chain computations and advanced dApp development
- [x] **Long-Term Economic Sustainability:** Ensured through storage rent, transaction fees from DeFi, and subpool mining

/// details | Scaling Ergo
    {type: info, open: false}
Creating a scalable blockchain infrastructure is a complex task. Ergo, fortified by a decade of [research](documents.md), rigorous testing, and ongoing development, has risen to the challenge. This guide will walk you through Ergo's sophisticated scalability features.

Blockchain scalability is primarily influenced by three factors:

- **Cryptoeconomic incentive model**: This model ensures that miners receive suitable rewards for the various costs associated with scaling a blockchain, which may include an increase in state-related costs.
- **Consensus model**: The chosen model can determine the feasibility of certain scalability solutions. For example, the Proof of Stake consensus model does not support Non-interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NiPoPoWs).
- **Accounting model**: This pertains to the management of transactions and operations within the blockchain. Bitcoin uses the UTXO Model, while Ethereum uses the Account Model.

Ergo's innovative approach to scalability, underpinned by these aspects, sets it apart from other blockchain technologies. Unlike Ethereum's Account model, which manages storage changes and validity checks on-chain during code execution, Ergo's [eUTXO](eutxo.md) employs a unique strategy: transactions are created off-chain, and validation checks are conducted on-chain.

This approach reduces the operational load on each network node, thereby enhancing overall efficiency. The immutability of the transaction graph allows for further optimization of this process, increasing the number of transactions processed per second. Additionally, the use of light-verifying nodes boosts both the scalability and accessibility of the network.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of Ergo's scalability, delve into the role of each layer in this process:

- [Layer 0](layer0.md): The *Network* or *Peer-to-Peer* Layer
- [Layer 1](layer1.md): The Core Blockchain Layer
- [Layer 2](layer2.md): The Off-chain Layer

These layers work in harmony to enhance Ergo's scalability, making it a flexible and potent choice for both developers and users. This collaborative model enables Ergo to provide robust, scalable solutions that are prepared to meet the challenges of global expansion.

/// details | Developing Digital Gold 2.0 and its Infrastructure 
    {type: tip, open: false}

The following is adapted from [this post on the R&D DAO for Ergo Core thread](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/ergodevs-r-d-dao-for-ergo-core/4663). 

**Vision**
The Ergo Core Dev DAO envisions Ergo as Digital Gold 2.0, a mineable digital commodity with trustless derivatives and expressive contracts. By building upon Ergo's robust DeFi ecosystem and introducing sidechains, we aim to expand the decentralized monetary base and derivative money supply, creating a more inclusive and accessible financial system for the Ergo community and beyond.

**Completed Milestones**
The Ergo platform, with the support of the Ergo Foundation and community developers, has already made significant strides in developing its infrastructure and DeFi ecosystem. This includes launching basic infrastructure such as wallets and explorers, as well as a wide range of DeFi tools and trustless derivatives, such as:

- [x] SigmaUSD stablecoin (Djed protocol)
- [x] Spectrum DEX (AMM-based)
- [x] ErgoMixer (non-interactive, non-custodial mixer)
- [x] ErgoAuctionHouse (peer-to-peer auctions)
- [x] SigmaFi (peer-to-peer loans via bonds)
- [x] Duckpools (lending pools)
- [x] ErgoRaffle (decentralized crowdfunding)
- [x] EXLE (uncollateralized lending)
- [x] SigmaO (trustless options)
- [x] HodlCoin (trustless ERG derivative with non-declining price)
- [x] AuctionCoin (emission via auctions)
- [x] Oracle Pools (federated transparent data providing)
- [x] Rosen Bridge (two-layered federated bridge)

These tools collectively contribute to the creation of more trustless collateral through various means such as AuctionCoin, OptionCoin, and fair initial mining offerings. As a result, Ergo's decentralized monetary base and derivative money supply continue to grow. It's worth noting that the entire DeFi ecosystem on Ergo is built upon its unique ErgoTree/ErgoScript contractual layer, also known as Sigma, which provides a secure and flexible foundation for the development of complex financial applications.

**Upcoming Milestones**
Looking ahead, key milestones include:

- [ ] The launch of new DeFi tools such as Paideia, Dexy/Gluon stablecoins, ChainCash, Analog Ergo, and OptionCoin
- [ ] Implementing sidechains with trustless transfers and various consensus mechanisms (merged mined with ERG, other blockchains, or double merged mined)
- [ ] Expanding Ergo's contractual layer to sidechains, incorporating features like Bulletproofs-based sigma protocols and elevating certain contracts to first-class citizens
- [ ] Experimenting with scalability solutions like sharding on sidechains
- [ ] Utilizing ERG and other tokens on Ergo and sidechains from launch, fostering a rich and diverse DeFi ecosystem
- [ ] Launching existing applications on sidechains, contingent on modifications to the contractual layer

By achieving these milestones, the Ergo Core Dev DAO aims to establish Ergo and its Sigma layer as a central hub for UTXO PoW blockchains with powerful smart contract capabilities.

**Monetization Strategies for ErgoDevs DAO**
To ensure the sustainability and growth of the Ergo ecosystem, the ErgoDevs DAO is exploring various monetization strategies, such as:

- [ ] Receiving a percentage of sidechain token emissions, similar to the Ergo Treasury contract
- [ ] Offering consultancy services and support for launching applications on sigma chains

These strategies will help fund ongoing development and foster a thriving community of developers and users around the Ergo platform, in collaboration with the Ergo Foundation and the wider Ergo community.
